<p class="intro"><a name="On_the_Importance" id="On_the_Importance"></a>On the Importance of an Examination of the Structure of the Integument
of Crustacea in the determination of doubtful Species.&mdash;Application to
the genus <i>Galathea</i>, with the Description of a New Species of that
Genus. By <span class="smcap">Spence Bate</span>, Esq., F.L.S.</p>

<p class="read">[Read January 21, 1858.]</p>


<p class="first">Of the various genera of Decapod Crustacea none are more interesting, or
more difficult of description, than those which constitute the family
Galathead&aelig;.</p>

<p>The interest attaching to these forms arises from the intermediate
position which they occupy in the natural arrangement of the class,
their structure placing them between the Macrura and Brachyura; in
accordance with which we find that, whilst Professor M.-Edwards classes
them among the Macrura, Professor Bell, in his work on the British
Crustacea, places them (more correctly, as we think) in the intermediate
group of Anomura.</p>

<p>This opinion is fully borne out both in the development of the animals
and in their structure in the adult state.</p>

<p>The early form of the larva bears, anteriorly, a resemblance to the
Brachyural type, whilst the caudal appendages assimilate to those of the
Macrura. The same conditions obtain in the young of Anomura. At the time
of birth, the larva, like that of the Brachyura, has only the two
gnathopoda developed, whilst the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> termination of the tail is like that
of a fish, as in the Macrura. In the adult, the internal antenn&aelig; possess
short flagella and complementary appendages, such as exist in the order
Brachyura, whilst the external antenn&aelig; have the long and slender
flagella proper to the Macrura. The <i>scale</i>, however, commonly appended
to the external antenn&aelig; in the latter order is wanting, a circumstance
which exhibits a relation to the Brachyura.</p>

<p>An examination of the legs shows that the cox&aelig; are fused with the
thorax, as in the Brachyura, and not articulated with it as in the
Macrura, whilst, on the other hand, the posterior division and caudal
termination approach the Macrural type more nearly than that of the
Brachyura, the animal thus assuming a character intermediate between the
two orders.</p>

<p>But in the description of the several species of the genus <i>Galathea</i>, a
peculiar difficulty appears to arise, originating in the affinity which
they bear to each other. So close, in fact, is the approximation, that
the descriptions of the best writers will scarcely avail for the
distinction of the individual species without the assistance of figures.
This arises from the fact that the general characters, upon which the
descriptions are based, vary, in this genus, only in their comparative
degrees of development.</p>

<p>In the three species recognized in Professor Bell's work on the British
Crustacea, it will be found that each species retains the same
characters in greater or less degree.</p>

<p><i>Galathea strigosa</i> is peculiar for the spinous character of the
carapace and cheliform legs. Every spine, however, is repeated in both
the other species, only less developed. We find the rostrum furnished
with four lateral teeth on each side, a character which also exists in
each of the other species; and although close observation may detect a
slightly different arrangement in the relative position of these teeth,
the differences are not of sufficient importance to enable a naturalist
thence to derive a specific distinction, unless the peculiarity is
seconded by some more unqualified character less liable to be affected
by any peculiarity of condition.</p>

<p>In order to arrive at more certain results in the identification of
species, we think that the microscopic examination of the surface of the
integument will be found peculiarly useful.</p>

<p>This mode of examination of species may also be applied to a
considerable extent throughout the Crustacea generally with great
advantage; and if found valuable in recent, there can be no doubt that
it will prove of far greater importance in extinct forms, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> parts
on which the identification of species visually rests are lost, and
fragments only of the animal obtainable.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that, as the structure in question undergoes
modifications more or less considerable in different parts of the
animal, it will always be advisable to compare the corresponding parts
with each other.</p>

<p>Applying this test to the known species of <i>Galathea,</i> we perceive that
the structure of the integument upon the arms, independent of the
marginal spines, exhibits a squamiform appearance, but that the scales,
which characterise the structure, possess features peculiar to each
species.</p>

<p>In <i>Galathea strigosa</i> the scales are convex, distant from each other,
smooth at the edge, and fringed with long hairs. In <i>G. squamifera</i> they
are convex, closely placed, scalloped at the edge, and without hairs. In
<i>G. nexa</i> the scales are obsolete, tufts of hair representing the
supposed edges. In <i>G. depressa</i>, n. sp., the scales are broad, less
convex than in <i>G. strigosa</i> and <i>G. squamifera</i>, smooth, closely set,
and fringed with short hairs. In <i>G. Andrewsii</i> they are small, distant,
very convex, tipped with red, and slightly furnished with hair.</p>

<p>As another instance of the practical application of the microscopical
examination of the surface, I would refer to two species of Amphipoda,
classed by Leach under the name of <i>Gammarus Locusta</i>, from his
inability to assign them any separate specific characters. In the
structure of their integuments, however, these two forms will be found
to exhibit widely different microscopical appearances.</p>

<p>Again, there exists in the same group three or four species, the
description of any one of which would apply to either of the others; and
it is probable they would never have been ranked as separate species had
not their habitats been geographically distant. Thus <i>Gammarus Olivii</i>,
M.-Ed., <i>G. affinis</i>, M.-E., <i>G. Kr&ouml;yii</i>, Rathke, and <i>G. gracilis</i>, R.,
can only be specifically determined by a microscopic examination of the
integument.</p>

<p>The same may be said of other Amphipoda, such as <i>Urothoe inostratus</i>,
Dana, from South America, which so nearly resembles in form the <i>U.
elegans</i> of the British shores.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Galathea dispersa</span>, mihi.</p>

<div class="define">
<p><i>G.</i> rostro brevi, dentibus 4 utrinque ornato, 2 anterioribus
minoribus; pedibus anterioribus elongatis, sparse spiosus; chelarum
digitis parallelis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Galathea with short rostrum, armed on each side with 4 teeth, the
two posterior being less important than the two anterior. The
fingers of the chel&aelig; impinge through their whole length; outer
margin of the hand furnished with 3 or 4 small spines.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Trawling-ground, Plymouth, common; Moray Frith, Scotland. </p>
</div>

<p>This species unites <i>G. Andrewsii</i> with <i>G. nexa</i>, and, I think, has
often been mistaken for the young of the latter; but <i>G. nexa</i>, so far
as my experience goes, is a species peculiar to the north of England,
whereas <i>G. dispersa</i>, I anticipate, will be found to be the most
universally dispersed, in deep water, of any of the species known. It
can always be detected from <i>G. nexa</i> by the form of the hand and the
manner in which the fingers impinge: in <i>G. nexa</i> the hand is broad
towards the extremity, and the fingers meet only at the apex; in <i>G.
dispersa</i> the hand gradually narrows to the apex, and the fingers meet
each other through their whole length, the inner margin of the finger
being finely serrated, the thumb not.</p>

<p>It also may be distinguished from <i>G. Andrewsii</i> by the breadth of the
hands, which are narrow and round in <i>G. Andrewsii</i>, and moderately
broad and flat in <i>G. dispersa</i>.</p>

<p>By an examination of the texture of the integument under a magnifying
power of low degree, the surface of <i>G. dispersa</i> will be seen
distinctly to differ from that of any of the others; it is covered with
flat scales, fringed with short cilia. The length of the animal,
including the arms, is about 2&frac14; inches.</p>

<p class="first">This collection of the Hymenoptera of Celebes is specially interesting,
as adding greatly to our knowledge of the geographical range of many
well-known species, while the additions made to the Fossorial group
contain many of great beauty and rarity. A new species belonging to the
tribe of Solitary Wasps, <i>Odynerus clavicornis</i>, is perhaps the most
interesting insect in the collection; this Wasp has clavate antenn&aelig;, the
flagellum being broadly dilated towards the apex, convex above and
concave beneath. I am not acquainted with any other insect belonging to
the Vespidious group which exhibits such an anomaly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;The body is nearly cylindrical, somewhat depressed, the
carapace very much curved from the point to the back, quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> straight
from side to side; the anterior and lateral margins forming nearly a
semicircle, the posterior margin straight; the orbits are deeply cut in
the anterior margin of the carapace, looking upwards; the inferior
margin wanting; the oral aperture much arched anteriorly; the external
footjaws with the third articulation somewhat rhomboid, the fourth
irregularly oval, and the palpi three-jointed, inserted at its anterior
and inner angle. Epistome extremely small, transversely linear; the
external antenn&aelig; placed directly beneath the orbits, the basal joints
partly filling them beneath. The antennules folded transversely in large
open foss&aelig;, which are scarcely at all separated from each other, and are
open to the orbits, the eyes lying transversely; the peduncles short and
thick; the sternum is semicircular, the segments separated by very deep
grooves; the abdomen very long and narrow, the first and second joint
transversely linear, the third and fourth united and forming a triangle
truncated anteriorly at the articulation of the portion formed by the
fifth and sixth joints united, and which with the seventh form a very
narrow and linear piece extending forwards to the posterior margin of
the oral aperture; the first pair of legs robust, unequal (the right
being the larger in the only specimen at present observed); the hand in
each as broad as it is long; that of the smaller conspicuously
tuberculated, that of the larger much less so; the former with the
fingers nearly meeting throughout their length, those of the latter only
at the tips; the second, third, and fourth pairs of legs are long,
somewhat compressed, the third joint tuberculated on the under side, the
third pair the longest; the fifth pair is reduced to a mere rudiment, in
the form of a minute tubercle inserted in a little notch at the base of
the first joint of the fourth pair, and scarcely discernible by the
naked eye.</p>

<p><i>Observations.</i>&mdash;The relation of this genus to the Pinnotherid&aelig; is
tolerably obvious, in the smallness of the antenn&aelig;, the direction and
arrangement of the eyes, and particularly in the form of the oral
aperture, and of the external footjaws. I shall not, however, enter upon
the consideration of these relations, as I am about shortly to offer to
the Society a review and monograph of the whole of this family. The most
remarkable peculiarity in the genus is the apparent absence of the fifth
pair of legs, which can only be discovered to exist at all by
examination with the help of a lens. In this respect I doubt not that
the Fabrician genus <i>Hexapus</i>, adopted and figured by De Haan, will be
found to agree with it, although it is very remarkable that the
anomalous condition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> of this part never excited any particular attention
on the part of either of these distinguished naturalists; and De Haan
describes Fabricius's species, <i>Hexapus sexpes</i>, as if there were
nothing especial or abnormal in a Decapod having only six pairs of legs
besides the claws. Mr. White made a similar mistake on one occasion,
when he described an anomourous genus allied to <i>Lithodes</i>, in which the
fifth pair of legs were not visible; but when, at my suggestion, a more
careful examination was made, they were found, as was anticipated, in a
rudimentary form, concealed under the edge of the carapace. I believe
that I can discover even in De Haan's figure something like a little
tubercle at the base of the fourth leg, which is probably the
rudimentary representative of the fifth.</p>

Fungus. By the Rev. <span class="smcap">Henry Higgins</span>. Communicated by the President.</p>

<p class="read">[Read June 3rd, 1858.]</p>


<p class="first">On the 18th of March last, Timpron Martin, Esq., of Liverpool,
communicated to me some circumstances respecting the death of a hive of
bees in his possession, which induced me to request from him a full
statement of particulars. Mr. Martin gave me the following account:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In October last I had three hives of bees which I received into my
house. Each doorway was closed, and the hive placed upon a piece of
calico; the corners were brought over the top, leaving a loop by which
the hive was suspended from the ceiling. The hives were taken down about
the 14th of March; two were healthy, but all the bees in the third were
dead. There was a gallon of bees. The two hives containing live bees
were much smaller; but in each of them were dead ones. Under whatever
circumstances you preserve bees through the winter, dead ones are found
at the bottom, in the spring. The room, an attic, was dry; and I had
preserved the same hives in the same way during the winter of 1856. In
what I may call the dead hive there was an abundance of honey when it
was opened; and it is clear that its inmates did not die for want. It is
not a frequent occurrence for bees so to die; but I have known another
instance. In that case the hive was left out in the ordinary way, and
possibly cold was the cause of death. I think it probable that my bees
died about a month before the 14th of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> March, merely from the
circumstance that some one remarked about that time that there was no
noise in the hive. They might have died earlier; but there were
certainly live bees in the hive in January. I understand there was an
appearance of mould on some of the combs. There was ample ventilation, I
think; indeed, as the bees were suspended, they had more air than
through the summer when placed on a stand."</p>

<p>When the occurrence was first made known to me, I suggested that the
bees might probably have died from the growth of a fungus, and requested
some of the dead bees might be sent for examination. They were
transmitted to me in a very dry state; and a careful inspection with a
lens afforded no indications of vegetable growth. I then broke up a
specimen, and examined the portions under a compound microscope, using a
Nachet No. 4. The head and thorax were clean; but on a portion of the
sternum were innumerable very minute, linear, slightly curved bodies,
showing the well-known oscillatory or swarming motion. Notwithstanding
the agreement of these minute bodies with the characters of the genus of
<i>Bacterium</i> of the Vibrionia, I regarded them as spermatia, having
frequently seen others undistinguishable from them under circumstances
inconsistent with the presence of <i>Conferv&aelig;</i>, as in the interior of the
immature peridia and sporangia of Fungals.</p>

<p>In the specimen first examined there were no other indications of the
growth of any parasite; but from the interior of the abdomen of a second
bee I obtained an abundance of well-defined globular bodies resembling
the spores of a fungus, varying in size from .00016 to .00012 in. Three
out of four specimens subsequently examined contained similar spores
within the abdomen. No traces of a mycelium were visible; the plants had
come to maturity, fruited, and withered away, leaving only the spores.</p>

<p>The chief question then remaining to be solved was as to the time when
the spores were developed; whether before or after the death of the
bees. In order, if possible, to determine this, I placed four of the
dead bees in circumstances favourable for the germination of the spores,
and in about ten days I submitted them again to examination. They were
covered with mould, consisting chiefly of a species of <i>Mucor</i>, and one
also of <i>Botrytis</i> or <i>Botryosporium</i>. These fungi were clearly
extraneous, covering indifferently all parts of the insects, and
spreading on the wood on which they were lying. On the abdomen of all
the specimens, and on the clypeus of one of them, grew a fungus wholly
unlike the surrounding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> mould. It was white and very short, and
apparently consisted entirely of spores arranged in a moniliform manner,
like the fertile filaments of a stemless <i>Penicillium</i>. These spores
resembled those found in the abdomen of the Bees, and proceeded I think,
from them. The filaments were most numerous at the junction of the
segments. The spores did not resemble the globules in <i>Sporendonema
musc&aelig;</i> of the English Flora, neither were they apparently enclosed.</p>

<p>The Rev. M. J. Berkeley, to whom I sent some of the bees, procured, by
scraping the interior of the abdomen with a lancet, very minute, curved
linear bodies from 1/8000 to 1/10000 in. long, which he compares to
Vibrios. He also found mixed with them globular bodies, but no visible
stratum of mould.</p>

<p>From the peculiar position of the supposed spores within the abdomen of
the bees, and from the subsequent growth of a fungus unlike any of our
common forms of Mucedines, I think it probable that the death of the
bees was occasioned by the presence of a parasitic fungus.</p>

London Clay Formation near Highgate. By <span class="smcap">John W. Wetherell</span>. Communicated
by <span class="smcap">James Yates</span>, Esq., M.A., F.L.S.</p>

<p class="read">[Read June 3rd, 1858.]</p>


<p class="first">The London clay is very tenacious, and near the surface is generally of
a brown colour, probably owing to the decomposition of the iron pyrites
which it contains. It abounds in selenite or sulphate of lime, and in
nodules which often contain organic remains. Fossil wood with <i>Teredo
antenaut&aelig;</i> is also met with, and pyritous casts of univalve and bivalve
shells. Lower down the stratum becomes more compact and is of a bluish
or blackish colour, and its fossil contents are in a fine state of
preservation. During the last summer, while examining the London Clay in
the vicinity of Highgate in search of fossils, my attention was directed
to certain appearances in it which I could not account for. This led to
a further examination, when I found they were produced by the borings of
<i>Lumbrici</i> or earth-worms. These appearances consisted of long tubes
passing nearly perpendicularly through the clay and terminating in
receptacles or <i>nidi</i>, each tube leading to a separate receptacle. As
these receptacles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> occurred in large numbers, I had an opportunity of
examining a great many of them with various results. In one instance, I
found a dead worm coiled up; in another, a portion of a worm protruding
into the lower part of the tube. Again, <i>nidi</i> were found partially
filled with only the casts of worms, whilst others contained more or
less of a species of Conferva; and, lastly, I obtained some with the
cavities partially or wholly filled up. The receptacles varied in shape,
from a sphere to an oval, and were extremely thin and fragile. They also
varied in size from a pea to a nut. Externally they presented an
appearance so singularly contorted, that I could not help considering
they were moulded from the casts of worms. They did not appear to have
any attachment to the surrounding clay, except at the point of junction
with the tube; and the clay beneath them presented no unusual
appearance.</p>

<p>Internally they generally exhibited impressions of the worm; but
occasionally I detected some of the round and contorted appearances
which I have mentioned as being so conspicuous on the outside. I cannot
speak with precision as to the length of the tubes, as the clay when
examined had been broken up into large rough masses in digging for the
foundations of houses. The largest noticed was about three inches long,
and the general width one-eighth of an inch. They often run parallel to
each other, but at unequal distances. I now have to notice what I
consider a remarkable circumstance, namely, that all the tubes contained
a solid cylinder of clay, and in every instance where the worms occurred
under the circumstances above recorded, they were found to be dead.
Researches of this kind are calculated to throw a light on some of those
singular phenomena which geologists occasionally meet with in the older
rocks.</p>

<p class="first">We found upon the larger islands the small species of the Kangaroo,
bearing the native name Wallaby (<i>Halmaturus Billardierii</i>),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> which,
when mixed with other meats, affords a fine-flavoured soup.</p>

<p>On the islets are flocks of the Cape Banca goose, which Mr. Smith
informed me were only to be found in these straits in the vicinity of
Flinders Island, from Cape Banca to Cape Frankland (west about), and
that they are readily domesticated, and hatch from three to seven eggs,
and afford an acceptable dish. I obtained a live specimen, which Dr.
Rayner of this ship describes thus:&mdash;"<i>Cereopsis Nov&aelig; Hollandi&aelig;</i>. Body
about the size of a common goose; bill short, vaulted, obtuse,
two-thirds of which is covered by an expanded cere of a pale
greenish-yellow colour, the tip of the bill being black, arcuated, and
truncated. Nostrils large, round, open, and situated in the middle of
the bill. Wings ample, third quill longest. Legs long, light dull-red,
and naked to a little above the knee. Feet black, webbed, the membrane
being deeply notched, great toe articulated to the metatarsus. Plumage
slate-grey, with black spots upon the wings and back. Wing-feathers
dusky black, and edged at the tip with pale grey. Irides light hazel."</p>

<p>We likewise obtained specimens of the following wildfowl:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Mutton Bird we observed streaming from island to island; and I
learnt from Mr. Benvenuto Smith the following particulars of its habits
from his own observations.</p>

<p>The male birds come in from sea in the month of September, and prepare
the burrows for the reception of the hens. The hen bird does not make
her appearance till about the 25th November, when she lays and sits at
once.</p>

<p>The Mutton Bird lays but one egg; they are employed rearing the young
bird until the month of May, at which time the old birds leave the young
ones to shift for themselves; the young birds remain in the burrows till
they are starved down, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> set off to sea, and are not seen again
amongst the islands till September. The cock and hen sit alternately
night and day; and all the labour of providing for the young is equally
shared.</p>

<p>There are at this date about ninety people living on the small islands
in "Franklin Inlet" who make a livelihood by gathering the oil,
feathers, and eggs of the Mutton Bird.</p>

<p>Upwards of 2000 gallons of the oil are extracted from the birds
annually; and although 300,000 birds are known to be destroyed each
year, they appear undiminished in numbers. The oil burns well, and is of
a bright-red colour.</p>

<p>I was presented by Mr. Smith with two Paper Nautilus shells (<i>Argonauta
tuberculosa</i>) found on the shore of Flinders Island this season, a
circumstance which he has remarked occurs but every seventh year, when
many hundreds are thrown up: the shells are rarely obtained perfect, as
they are extremely fragile, and the sea fowl pick the fish out of them.</p>

<p>Our Botanic Collector, Mr. Milne, ascertained, from what he obtained
himself and from what we could contribute from our individual visits to
the islets, the existence of plants, which he believes to be indigenous,
belonging to the following families and genera, viz.</p>

<p>Testing the chances of fish refreshment at this anchorage, we found
little encouragement for hook and line; but the two favouring
opportunities which the weather allowed for hawling the seine produced
as tabulated on opposite page.</p>

<p>We found the Reef Islands in this sound so abundant in rabbits since
Captain Stokes's forethought had set some loose upon them, that, in two
visits of four hours with but four guns, 100 brace were brought on
board.</p>

<p>I took care to follow my esteemed brother officers' example and the
system of introducing such productions, and obtained a dozen couple
alive for letting loose in Shark Bay.</p>

F.R.S., Professor of Natural History, Government School of Mines.</p>

<p class="read">[Read June 3rd, 1858.]</p>


<p class="first">Some time ago my friend Dr. Sinclair, of New Zealand, had the kindness
to offer me two specimens of the Pearly Nautilus which had been brought
to him from New Caledonia, preserved in Goadby's solution. I gladly
accepted the present, and looked forward to the dissection of the rare
animal with no little pleasure; but on proceeding to examine one of the
specimens, I found its anatomical value greatly diminished by the manner
in which a deposit from the solution had glued together some of the
internal viscera. Other parts of the Nautilus, however, were in a very
good state of preservation; and I have noted down such novel and
interesting peculiarities as they presented, in the hope that an account
of them will be acceptable to the Linnean Society.</p>

<p>Of the six apertures which, besides the genital and anal outlets, open
into the branchial cavity of <i>Nautilus pompilius</i>, one on each side lies
immediately above and in front of that fold of the inner wall of the
mantle which forms the lower root of the smaller and inner gill, and
encloses the branchial vein of that gill. The aperture is elongated and
narrow, with rather prominent lips. It measures about 1/8th of an inch.</p>

<p>The other two apertures are larger, and lie at a distance of 7/16ths of
an inch below and behind the other. They are in close juxta-position,
being separated only by a thin triangular fold of membrane, which
constitutes the inner lip of the one and the outer lip of the other.</p>

<p>The inner aperture is the larger, measuring 3/16ths of an inch in long
diameter, and having the form of a triangle with its base directed
posteriorly. The outer aperture is not more than 1/8th of an inch long.
The two apertures lie just above the edge of the fold of membrane which
runs from the inner root of the larger or outer branchia, across the
branchial cavity and beneath the rectum, to the other side.</p>

<p>These apertures lead into five sacs, which collectively constitute what
has been described as the pericardium. The sacs into which the superior
apertures open, by a short wide canal with folded walls, are situated on
each side of and above the rectum. Their inner boundaries are separated
by a space of not less than 5/8ths of an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> inch in width, in which lie
the vena cava and the oviduct. Each cavity has a rounded circumference,
and a transverse diameter of about half an inch. In a direction at right
angles to this diameter the dimensions vary with its state of
distension; but a quarter of an inch would be a fair average.</p>

<p>The anterior or outer wall of the cavity is formed by the mantle; the
posterior, inner, or visceral wall by a delicate membrane. The former
separates it from the branchial cavity; the latter from the fifth sac,
to be described by-and-by. I could find no natural aperture in the thin
inner wall, so that I conceive no communication can take place between
either of these sacs and the fifth sac.</p>

<p>Two irregular, flattened, brownish, soft plates depend from the
posterior wall of the sac into its cavity; their attached edges are
fixed along a line which is directed from behind obliquely forwards and
upwards.</p>

<p>The outer and smaller of the inferior apertures on each side leads into
a sac of similar dimensions and constitution to the preceding, but
having a less rounded outline in consequence of its being flattened in
one direction against its fellow of the opposite side, from which it is
separated only by a delicate membranous wall, whilst on another side it
is applied against the inferior wall of the superior sac, and is in like
manner separated from it only by a thin and membranous partition.</p>

<p>Like the upper sacs, each of these has two dark-brown, lamellar,
glandular masses depending from its membranous visceral wall.</p>

<p>A delicate, but broad, triangular membranous process, about 1/4th of an
inch long, hangs down freely from the visceral wall of the cavity just
behind the opening of the short canal which connects the sac with its
aperture.</p>

<p>The third and largest aperture on each side opens directly into a very
large fifth cavity, whose boundary is formed anteriorly by the visceral
walls of the sacs already described, and behind this by the mantle
itself as far as the horny band which marks and connects the insertion
of the shell-muscles.</p>

<p>In fact this cavity may be said to be co-extensive with the attached
part of the mantle,&mdash;the viscera, enclosed within their delicate
"peritoneal" membranous coat, projecting into and nearly filling it, but
nevertheless leaving a clear space between themselves and the delicate
posterior wall of the mantle.</p>

<p>A layer of the "peritoneal" membrane extends from the posterior edge of
the muscular expansion which lies between the shell-muscles and from the
upper wall of the dilatation of the vena cava,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> and passes upwards and
backwards like a diaphragm to the under surfaces of the gizzard and
liver. It is traversed by the aorta, to whose coats it closely adheres.</p>

<p>Along a line nearly corresponding with the horny band which proceeds
from the insertions of the shell-muscles and encircles the mantle below,
the pallial wall is produced inwards and forwards into a membranous fold
or ligament, which I will call the pallio-visceral ligament; and this
pallio-visceral ligament becoming attached to various viscera, divides
the great fifth chamber into an anterior inferior, and a posterior
superior portion, which communicate freely with one another.</p>

<p>Commencing with its extreme right-hand end, the ligament is inserted
into the line of reflection of the mantle, and then into the wall of the
oviduct, which becomes enclosed as it were within the ligament. The
latter then ends in a free edge on the inner side of the oviduct, and is
continued along it until it reaches the inferior surface of the apex of
the ovary, into which it is inserted.</p>

<p>The free edge is arcuated; and the rectum passes over it, but is in no
way connected with it.</p>

<p>Here, therefore, is one great passage of communication between the
anterior and posterior divisions of the fifth chamber.</p>

<p>On the left side, this aperture is limited by the heart, whose posterior
edge is, on the left side, connected by means of a ligamentous band with
the surface of the apex of the ovary; but on the right, for the greater
part of its extent, receives a process of the pallio-visceral ligament.
Between the ovario-cardiac ligament and this process lies the small oval
aperture already described by Professor Owen, which gives passage to the
siphonal artery. It constitutes the middle aperture of communication
between the two divisions of the fifth chamber.</p>

<p>The left-hand end of the ligament is inserted into the upper wall of the
dilated end of the vena cava; but between this point and the heart it
has a free arcuated edge, as on the right side.</p>

<p>Thus there are in reality three apertures of communication between the
two divisions of the fifth chamber, the middle, by far the smallest,
being alone hitherto known.</p>

<p>A delicate membranous band passes from the whole length of the middle
line of the rectum to the heart and to the ovary.</p>

<p>The singular "pyriform appendage" of the heart lies in the left process
of the ligament, its anterior edge nearly following the arcuated contour
of that process.</p>

<p>The siphuncular process of the mantle was broken in my specimen;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> but
its aperture appeared to communicate quite freely with the posterior
division of the fifth chamber.</p>

<p>Four sets of brownish, glandular-looking bodies depend into the anterior
division of the fifth chamber, from parts of the delicate septa dividing
this from the four small sacs, corresponding with the insertions of the
glandular bodies above described.</p>

<p>In fact, on distending the vena cava with air, it is found that the four
branchial arteries traverse these septa, and that the appendages in
question are diverticula of their walls. Consequently the anterior wall
of each branchial vein is produced into two glandular appendages, which
hang into one of the four smaller sacs, while the posterior wall is
produced into a single mass of appendages, which hangs into the anterior
division of the fifth chamber.</p>

<p>Although, as I believe, the five chambers do not communicate directly,
all the appendages must nevertheless be equally bathed with sea-water,
which enters by the apertures of the chambers.</p>

<p>An impacted yellowish-white concretionary matter filled the anterior
chamber; and a small quantity of it lay as a fine powder at the bottom
of the posterior one. In the latter, however, its presence might, by
possibility, have been accidental. My colleague, Dr. Percy, who kindly
undertook to examine this substance, informs me that he has been unable
to detect uric acid in it. The follicular appendages of the branchial
arteries present remarkable differences in their external appearance.
The eight which hang into the four anterior chambers are similar,
slightly festooned, but otherwise simple lamell&aelig;; while the four which
depend into the posterior chambers are produced into a number of
papillary processes. This external difference is obvious enough: whether
it be accompanied by a corresponding discrepancy in minute structure I
am unable to say; for I have not as yet been able to arrive at any
satisfactory results from the microscopic examination of the altered
tissues, and, as will be seen below, the only observer who has had the
opportunity of examining the Nautilus in the fresh state has not noted
any difference of structure in the two sets of follicles.</p>

<p>One is naturally led to seek among other mollusks for a structure
analogous to the vast posterior aquiferous chamber of the Nautilus; and
it appears to me that something quite similar is offered by the
<i>Ascidioida</i> and the <i>Brachiopoda</i>. In both cases, the viscera, inclosed
within a delicate tissue, project into a large cavity communicating
freely with the exterior by the cloacal aperture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> in the one case, and
by the funnel-shaped channels which have been miscalled "hearts" in the
other.</p>

<p>The rudimentary renal organs of the Ascidian are developed in the walls
of the cavity in question; and an aquiferous chamber of smaller
dimensions has the same relation to the kidney in Lamellibranchiata&mdash;in
Gasteropoda, Heteropoda, Pteropoda, and dibranchiate Cephalopoda. But
although such is likely enough to be the case, we do not know at present
that the aquiferous chambers in any of the last named mollusks attain an
extension similar to that which obtains in Nautilus.</p>

<p>On comparing the observations detailed above with the statements of
previous writers, I find that, in his well-known "Memoir on the Pearly
Nautilus" (1832), Professor Owen describes "on each side, at the roots
of the branchi&aelig;," "a small mamillary eminence with a transverse slit
which conducts from the branchial cavity into the pericardium. There is,
moreover, a foramen at the lower part of the cavity (<i>o</i>, pl. 5)
permitting the escape of a small vessel; and by the side of this vessel
a free passage is continued between the gizzard and ovary into the
membranous tube or siphon that traverses the divisions of the shell,
thus establishing a communication between the interior of that tube and
the exterior of the animal."</p>

<p>The foramen here described is easily seen; but, as I have stated, there
are other modes of communication between the so-called pericardium and
the cavity with which the siphuncle communicates, of a far more
extensive nature.</p>

<p>With respect to the pericardium itself, Professor Owen states, "The
peritoneum, after lining the cavity which contains the crop and liver,
and enveloping those viscera, forms two distinct pouches at the bottom
of the pallial sac, in one of which, the left, is contained the gizzard,
and in the other the ovary; anterior to these, and on the ventral aspect
of the liver, is another distinct cavity, of a square shape, which
contains the heart and principal vessels, with the glandular appendages
connected therewith." This is what the author terms the pericardium.</p>

<p>As Van der Hoeven has pointed out, however, the gizzard lies to the
right and the ovary to the left. Moreover, the gizzard is superior to
the ovary, so as only to overlap it a little above; and I can find no
evidence of the existence of such distinct pouches as those described.</p>

<p>Professor Owen states that the branchi&aelig; "arise by a common peduncle from
the inner surface of the mantle." My own observations,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> however, and Van
der Hoeven's figures, of both male and female, lead me to believe that
the peduncles of the branchi&aelig; are perfectly distinct from one another.</p>

<p>The follicles of the branchial arteries are thus described in the
"Memoir on the Pearly Nautilus:"&mdash;"They are short and pyriform and
closely set together. To each of the branchial arteries are appended
three clusters of these glands, of which one is larger than the united
volume of both the others; and the larger cluster is situated on one
side of the vessel and the two smaller on the opposite side. Each of
these clusters is contained in a membranous receptacle proper to itself,
partitioned off, as it were, from the pericardium, but communicating
with it.... The two canals which form the communication between the
pericardium and the branchial cavity commence at the receptacle of the
lesser cluster attached to the superior branchial arteries, and
terminate at the papill&aelig; before mentioned, which are situated at the
roots of the branchi&aelig;. The pericardium and these receptacles of the
glands, when first laid open, were found filled with a coagulated
substance so closely compacted as to require a careful removal, bit by
bit, before the contained follicles and vessels could be brought into
view."</p>

<p>Like Valenciennes and Van der Hoeven, I have been unable to find any
communication between the four sacs in which the small double clusters
of follicles are contained, and the "pericardium;" and I hold it to be
certain that the other four sets of follicles are not contained in sacs
at all, but lie free in the "pericardium" or posterior chamber.</p>

<p>No notice is here taken of the widely different characters of the
anterior and posterior follicles; and the figure gives both a similar
structure.</p>

<p>Valenciennes ("Nouvelles Recherches sur le Nautile Flamb&eacute;," 'Archives du
Mus&eacute;um,' ii., 1841) pointed out the existence of three pairs of
apertures opening into the branchial sac, besides the genital and anal
openings; and he affirms that they open into as many closed sacs, which
communicate neither with one another nor with the cavity that contains
the heart. M. Valenciennes indicates the difference in the structure of
the anterior and posterior venous appendages. He seems to me to have
seen something of the part which I have described as the pallio-visceral
ligament; but I cannot clearly comprehend either his figure or his
description.</p>

<p>Van der Hoeven, in his 'Contributions to the Knowledge of the Animal of
<i>Nautilus pompilius</i>,' 1850, confirmed the statement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> of Valenciennes
with regard to the existence of three pairs of apertures; but he showed,
in opposition to him, that one of these pairs of apertures communicated
with the pericardium. The sacs into which the other two pairs open are,
according to this anatomist, blind. In the aperture of the anterior
blind sac he found a concretionary matter which he supposed to contain
uric acid, but chemical analysis did not confirm the supposition. Van
der Hoeven refers to some observations by Vrolik; but as these are in
Dutch, and have not, so far as I can find, been translated into either
French, German, or English, I know not what they may contain.</p>

<p>In his more recent essay, translated in 'Wiegmann's Archiv' for 1857,
under the title of "Beitrag zur Anatomie von <i>Nautilus pompilius</i>," Van
der Hoeven states that he has again found hard concretions in the
chamber enclosing the appendage of the anterior branchial artery, and
that these on chemical analysis yielded phosphate of lime and traces of
fat and albumen, but no uric acid.</p>

<p>Mr. Macdonald, in a valuable paper on the anatomy of <i>Nautilus
umbilicatus</i>, published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1855, thus
describes the follicular appendages of the branchial arteries:&mdash;</p>

<p>"These follicles are subcylindrical in form, somewhat dilated at the
free extremity, to which is appended a folded and funnel-shaped process
of membrane, which expands rather suddenly, presenting a jagged and
irregular border. They open by a smooth and oval or slit-like, orifice
into the afferent pulmonary vessels, on each of which, as Professor Owen
has observed, they are disposed in three clusters. The outer membrane is
smooth and glassy, homogeneous in structure and sprinkled over with
minute rounded and transparent bodies, probably the nuclei of cells.
Beneath this layer, flat bundles of fibres, apparently muscular, are
traceable here and there, principally disposed in a longitudinal
direction, and sometimes branched. The lining membrane consists of a
loose epithelial pavement in many respects similar to that of the
uriniferous tubules of the higher animals, the cells containing, besides
the nuclei, numerous minute oil-globules, or a substance much resembling
concrete fatty matter. This membrane is thrown up into an infinite
number of papill&aelig; and corrugations, so as to augment the extent of
surface considerably. The papill&aelig; are more numerous at the inner part or
towards the attached end; and a circlet of longitudinally disposed folds
radiate from the bottom of the follicles, in which a number of small
pits or fenestrations are sometimes visible. The sides of these folds
are wrinkled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> transversely so as to present a median zigzag elevation.
The funnel-shaped membranous process above noticed is continuous with
the lining membrane, consisting of an extension of the same epithelial
pavement; but the cells are somewhat larger and more regular in form.
The cavity of each follicle, therefore, communicates with the exterior
through the centre of this process; and the aperture is thus guarded by
a kind of circular valve, permitting the escape of secreted matter, but
effectually preventing the entrance of fluid from without."</p>

<p>In his fig. 9, pl. xv., Mr. Macdonald depicts certain "crystalline
bodies often occurring within the follicles."</p>

<p>From what Mr. Macdonald states, one would be led to conclude that all
the follicles have the same structure; but I suspect this to be an
oversight.</p>

four apertures; but the author states that "on each side, at the roots
of the anterior branchi&aelig;, there is a small mamillary eminence with a
transverse slit, which conducts from the branchial cavity to one of the
compartments of the pericardium containing two clusters of venous
glands. There are also two similar, but smaller, slits, contiguous to
one another, near the root of the posterior branchia on each side, which
lead to and may admit sea-water into the compartments containing the
posterior cluster of the venous follicles." In this work the ovary is
not only described, but <i>figured</i>, on the right side of the gizzard. The
figure, however, rightly places the greater part of the ovary below that
organ.</p>

<p class="read">[Read July 1st, 1858.]</p>

<p style="text-align: right">London, June 30th, 1858.</p>


<p class="first"><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir,</span>&mdash;The accompanying papers, which we have the honour of
communicating to the Linnean Society, and which all relate to the same
subject, viz. the Laws which affect the Production of Varieties, Races,
and Species, contain the results of the investigations of two
indefatigable naturalists, Mr. Charles Darwin and Mr. Alfred Wallace.</p>

<p>These gentlemen having, independently and unknown to one another,
conceived the same very ingenious theory to account for the appearance
and perpetuation of varieties and of specific forms on our planet, may
both fairly claim the merit of being original thinkers in this important
line of inquiry; but neither of them having published his views, though
Mr. Darwin has for many years past been repeatedly urged by us to do so,
and both authors having now unreservedly placed their papers in our
hands, we think it would best promote the interests of science that a
selection from them should be laid before the Linnean Society.</p>

<p>Taken in the order of their dates, they consist of:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Extracts from a MS. work on Species<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>, by Mr. Darwin, which was
sketched in 1839, and copied in 1844, when the copy was read by Dr.
Hooker, and its contents afterwards communicated to Sir Charles Lyell.
The first Part is devoted to "The Variation of Organic Beings under
Domestication and in their Natural State;" and the second chapter of
that Part, from which we propose to read to the Society the extracts
referred to, is headed, "On the Variation of Organic Beings in a state
of Nature; on the Natural Means of Selection; on the Comparison of
Domestic Races and true Species."</p>

<p>2. An abstract of a private letter addressed to Professor Asa Gray, of
Boston, U.S., in October 1857, by Mr. Darwin, in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> he repeats his
views, and which shows that these remained unaltered from 1839 to 1857.</p>

<p>3. An Essay by Mr. Wallace, entitled "On the Tendency of Varieties to
depart indefinitely from the Original Type." This was written at Ternate
in February 1858, for the perusal of his friend and correspondent Mr.
Darwin, and sent to him with the expressed wish that it should be
forwarded to Sir Charles Lyell, if Mr. Darwin thought it sufficiently
novel and interesting. So highly did Mr. Darwin appreciate the value of
the views therein set forth, that he proposed, in a letter to Sir
Charles Lyell, to obtain Mr. Wallace's consent to allow the Essay to be
published as soon as possible. Of this step we highly approved, provided
Mr. Darwin did not withhold from the public, as he was strongly inclined
to do (in favour of Mr. Wallace), the memoir which he had himself
written on the same subject, and which, as before stated, one of us had
perused in 1844, and the contents of which we had both of us been privy
to for many years. On representing this to Mr. Darwin, he gave us
permission to make what use we thought proper of his memoir, &amp;c.; and in
adopting our present course, of presenting it to the Linnean Society, we
have explained to him that we are not solely considering the relative
claims to priority of himself and his friend, but the interests of
science generally; for we feel it to be desirable that views founded on
a wide deduction from facts, and matured by years of reflection, should
constitute at once a goal from which others may start, and that, while
the scientific world is waiting for the appearance of Mr. Darwin's
complete work, some of the leading results of his labours, as well as
those of his able correspondent, should together be laid before the
public.</p>

<p class="intro">I. <i>Extract from an unpublished Work on Species, by</i> <span class="smcap">C. Darwin</span>, Esq.,
<i>consisting of a portion of a Chapter entitled, "On the Variation of
Organic Beings in a state of Nature; on the Natural Means of Selection;
on the Comparison of Domestic Races and true Species.</i>"</p>

<p>De Candolle, in an eloquent passage, has declared that all nature is at
war, one organism with another, or with external nature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> Seeing the
contented face of nature, this may at first well be doubted; but
reflection will inevitably prove it to be true. The war, however, is not
constant, but recurrent in a slight degree at short periods, and more
severely at occasional more distant periods; and hence its effects are
easily overlooked. It is the doctrine of Malthus applied in most cases
with tenfold force. As in every climate there are seasons, for each of
its inhabitants, of greater and less abundance, so all annually breed;
and the moral restraint which in some small degree checks the increase
of mankind is entirely lost. Even slow-breeding mankind has doubled in
twenty-five years; and if he could increase his food with greater ease,
he would double in less time. But for animals without artificial means,
the amount of food for each species must, <i>on an average</i>, be constant,
whereas the increase of all organisms tends to be geometrical, and in a
vast majority of cases at an enormous ratio. Suppose in a certain spot
there are eight pairs of birds, and that <i>only</i> four pairs of them
annually (including double hatches) rear only four young, and that these
go on rearing their young at the same rate, then at the end of seven
years (a short life, excluding violent deaths, for any bird) there will
be 2048 birds, instead of the original sixteen. As this increase is
quite impossible, we must conclude either that birds do not rear nearly
half their young, or that the average life of a bird is, from accident,
not nearly seven years. Both checks probably concur. The same kind of
calculation applied to all plants and animals affords results more or
less striking, but in very few instances more striking than in man.</p>

<p>Many practical illustrations of this rapid tendency to increase are on
record, among which, during peculiar seasons, are the extraordinary
numbers of certain animals; for instance, during the years 1826 to 1828,
in La Plata, when from drought some millions of cattle perished, the
whole country actually <i>swarmed</i> with mice. Now I think it cannot be
doubted that during the breeding-season all the mice (with the exception
of a few males or females in excess) ordinarily pair, and therefore that
this astounding increase during three years must be attributed to a
greater number than usual surviving the first year, and then breeding,
and so on till the third year, when their numbers were brought down to
their usual limits on the return of wet weather. Where man has
introduced plants and animals into a new and favourable country, there
are many accounts in how surprisingly few years the whole country has
become stocked with them. This increase would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> necessarily stop as soon
as the country was fully stocked; and yet we have every reason to
believe, from what is known of wild animals, that <i>all</i> would pair in
the spring. In the majority of cases it is most difficult to imagine
where the checks fall&mdash;though generally, no doubt, on the seeds, eggs,
and young; but when we remember how impossible, even in mankind (so much
better known than any other animal), it is to infer from repeated casual
observations what the average duration of life is, or to discover the
different percentage of deaths to births in different countries, we
ought to feel no surprise at our being unable to discover where the
check falls in any animal or plant. It should always be remembered, that
in most cases the checks are recurrent yearly in a small, regular
degree, and in an extreme degree during unusually cold, hot, dry, or wet
years, according to the constitution of the being in question. Lighten
any check in the least degree, and the geometrical powers of increase in
every organism will almost instantly increase the average number of the
favoured species. Nature may be compared to a surface on which rest ten
thousand sharp wedges touching each other and driven inwards by
incessant blows. Fully to realize these views much reflection is
requisite. Malthus on man should be studied; and all such cases as those
of the mice in La Plata, of the cattle and horses when first turned out
in South America, of the birds by our calculation, &amp;c., should be well
considered. Reflect on the enormous multiplying power <i>inherent and
annually in action</i> in all animals; reflect on the countless seeds
scattered by a hundred ingenious contrivances, year after year, over the
whole face of the land; and yet we have every reason to suppose that the
average percentage of each of the inhabitants of a country usually
remains constant. Finally, let it be borne in mind that this average
number of individuals (the external conditions remaining the same) in
each country is kept up by recurrent struggles against other species or
against external nature (as on the borders of the Arctic regions, where
the cold checks life), and that ordinarily each individual of every
species holds its place, either by its own struggle and capacity of
acquiring nourishment in some period of its life, from the egg upwards;
or by the struggle of its parents (in short-lived organisms, when the
main check occurs at longer intervals) with other individuals of the
<i>same</i> or <i>different</i> species.</p>

<p>But let the external conditions of a country alter. If in a small
degree, the relative proportions of the inhabitants will in most cases
simply be slightly changed; but let the number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> inhabitants be small,
as on an island, and free access to it from other countries be
circumscribed, and let the change of conditions continue progressing
(forming new stations), in such a case the original inhabitants must
cease to be as perfectly adapted to the changed conditions as they were
originally. It has been shown in a former part of this work, that such
changes of external conditions would, from their acting on the
reproductive system, probably cause the organization of those beings
which were most affected to become, as under domestication, plastic.
Now, can it be doubted, from the struggle each individual has to obtain
subsistence, that any minute variation in structure, habits, or
instincts, adapting that individual better to the new conditions, would
tell upon its vigour and health? In the struggle it would have a better
<i>chance</i> of surviving; and those of its offspring which inherited the
variation, be it ever so slight, would also have a better <i>chance</i>.
Yearly more are bred than can survive; the smallest grain in the
balance, in the long run, must tell on which death shall fall, and which
shall survive. Let this work of selection on the one hand, and death on
the other, go on for a thousand generations, who will pretend to affirm
that it would produce no effect, when we remember what, in a few years,
Bakewell effected in cattle, and Western in sheep, by this identical
principle of selection?</p>

<p>To give an imaginary example from changes in progress on an island:&mdash;let
the organization of a canine animal which preyed chiefly on rabbits, but
sometimes on hares, become slightly plastic; let these same changes
cause the number of rabbits very slowly to decrease, and the number of
hares to increase; the effect of this would be that the fox or dog would
be driven to try to catch more hares: his organization, however, being
slightly plastic, those individuals with the lightest forms, longest
limbs, and best eyesight, let the difference be ever so small, would be
slightly favoured, and would tend to live longer, and to survive during
that time of the year when food was scarcest; they would also rear more
young, which would tend to inherit these slight peculiarities. The less
fleet ones would be rigidly destroyed. I can see no more reason to doubt
that these causes in a thousand generations would produce a marked
effect, and adapt the form of the fox or dog to the catching of hares
instead of rabbits, than that greyhounds can be improved by selection
and careful breeding. So would it be with plants under similar
circumstances. If the number of individuals of a species with plumed
seeds could be increased by greater powers of dissemination within its
own area<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> (that is, if the check to increase fell chiefly on the seeds),
those seeds which were provided with ever so little more down, would in
the long run be most disseminated; hence a greater number of seeds thus
formed would germinate, and would tend to produce plants inheriting the
slightly better-adapted down<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>.</p>

<p>Besides this natural means of selection, by which those individuals are
preserved, whether in their egg, or larval, or mature state, which are
best adapted to the place they fill in nature, there is a second agency
at work in most unisexual animals, tending to produce the same effect,
namely, the struggle of the males for the females. These struggles are
generally decided by the law of battle, but in the case of birds,
apparently, by the charms of their song, by their beauty or their power
of courtship, as in the dancing rock-thrush of Guiana. The most vigorous
and healthy males, implying perfect adaptation, must generally gain the
victory in their contests. This kind of selection, however, is less
rigorous than the other; it does not require the death of the less
successful, but gives to them fewer descendants. The struggle falls,
moreover, at a time of year when food is generally abundant, and perhaps
the effect chiefly produced would be the modification of the secondary
sexual characters, which are not related to the power of obtaining food,
or to defence from enemies, but to fighting with or rivalling other
males. The result of this struggle amongst the males may be compared in
some respects to that produced by those agriculturists who pay less
attention to the careful selection of all their young animals, and more
to the occasional use of a choice mate.</p>


<p class="center">II. <i>Abstract of a Letter from</i> <span class="smcap">C. Darwin</span>, Esq., <i>to</i> Prof. <span class="smcap">Asa Gray</span>,
<i>Boston, U.S., dated Down, September 5th, 1857.</i></p>

<p>1. It is wonderful what the principle of selection by man, that is the
picking out of individuals with any desired quality, and breeding from
them, and again picking out, can do. Even breeders have been astounded
at their own results. They can act on differences inappreciable to an
uneducated eye. Selection has been <i>methodically</i> followed in <i>Europe</i>
for only the last half century; but it was occasionally, and even in
some degree methodically, followed in the most ancient times. There must
have been also a kind of unconscious selection from a remote period,
namely in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> the preservation of the individual animals (without any
thought of their offspring) most useful to each race of man in his
particular circumstances. The "roguing," as nurserymen call the
destroying of varieties which depart from their type, is a kind of
selection. I am convinced that intentional and occasional selection has
been the main agent in the production of our domestic races; but however
this may be, its great power of modification has been indisputably shown
in later times. Selection acts only by the accumulation of slight or
greater variations, caused by external conditions, or by the mere fact
that in generation the child is not absolutely similar to its parent.
Man, by this power of accumulating variations, adapts living beings to
his wants&mdash;may be said to make the wool of one sheep good for carpets,
of another for cloth, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. Now suppose there were a being who did not judge by mere external
appearances, but who could study the whole internal organization, who
was never capricious, and should go on selecting for one object during
millions of generations; who will say what he might not effect? In
nature we have some <i>slight</i> variation occasionally in all parts; and I
think it can be shown that changed conditions of existence is the main
cause of the child not exactly resembling its parents; and in nature
geology shows us what changes have taken place, and are taking place. We
have almost unlimited time; no one but a practical geologist can fully
appreciate this. Think of the Glacial period, during the whole of which
the same species at least of shells have existed; there must have been
during this period millions on millions of generations.</p>

<p>3. I think it can be shown that there is such an unerring power at work
in <i>Natural Selection</i> (the title of my book), which selects exclusively
for the good of each organic being. The elder De Candolle, W. Herbert,
and Lyell have written excellently on the struggle for life; but even
they have not written strongly enough. Reflect that every being (even
the elephant) breeds at such a rate, that in a few years, or at most a
few centuries, the surface of the earth would not hold the progeny of
one pair. I have found it hard constantly to bear in mind that the
increase of every single species is checked during some part of its
life, or during some shortly recurrent generation. Only a few of those
annually born can live to propagate their kind. What a trifling
difference must often determine which shall survive, and which perish!</p>

<p>4. Now take the case of a country undergoing some change. This will tend
to cause some of its inhabitants to vary slightly&mdash;not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> but that I
believe most beings vary at all times enough for selection to act on
them. Some of its inhabitants will be exterminated; and the remainder
will be exposed to the mutual action of a different set of inhabitants,
which I believe to be far more important to the life of each being than
mere climate. Considering the infinitely various methods which living
beings follow to obtain food by struggling with other organisms, to
escape danger at various times of life, to have their eggs or seeds
disseminated, &amp;c. &amp;c., I cannot doubt that during millions of
generations individuals of a species will be occasionally born with some
slight variation, profitable to some part of their economy. Such
individuals will have a better chance of surviving, and of propagating
their new and slightly different structure; and the modification may be
slowly increased by the accumulative action of natural selection to any
profitable extent. The variety thus formed will either coexist with, or,
more commonly, will exterminate its parent form. An organic being, like
the woodpecker or misseltoe, may thus come to be adapted to a score of
contingences&mdash;natural selection accumulating those slight variations in
all parts of its structure, which are in any way useful to it during any
part of its life.</p>

<p>5. Multiform difficulties will occur to every one, with respect to this
theory. Many can, I think, be satisfactorily answered. <i>Natura non facit
saltum</i> answers some of the most obvious. The slowness of the change,
and only a very few individuals undergoing change at any one time,
answers others. The extreme imperfection of our geological records
answers others.</p>

<p>6. Another principle, which may be called the principle of divergence,
plays, I believe, an important part in the origin of species. The same
spot will support more life if occupied by very diverse forms. We see
this in the many generic forms in a square yard of turf, and in the
plants or insects on any little uniform islet, belonging almost
invariably to as many genera and families as species. We can understand
the meaning of this fact amongst the higher animals, whose habits we
understand. We know that it has been experimentally shown that a plot of
land will yield a greater weight if sown with several species and genera
of grasses, than if sown with only two or three species. Now, every
organic being, by propagating so rapidly, may be said to be striving its
utmost to increase in numbers. So it will be with the offspring of any
species after it has become diversified into varieties, or subspecies,
or true species. And it follows, I think, from the foregoing facts, that
the varying offspring of each species will try<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> (only few will succeed)
to seize on as many and as diverse places in the economy of nature as
possible. Each new variety or species, when formed, will generally take
the place of, and thus exterminate its less well-fitted parent. This I
believe to be the origin of the classification and affinities of organic
beings at all times; for organic beings always <i>seem</i> to branch and

branches rudely representing extinct genera and families.</p>

<p class="center">III. <i>On the Tendency of Varieties to depart indefinitely from the
Original Type.</i> By <span class="smcap">Alfred Russell Wallace.</span></p>

<p>One of the strongest arguments which have been adduced to prove the
original and permanent distinctness of species is, that <i>varieties</i>
produced in a state of domesticity are more or less unstable, and often
have a tendency, if left to themselves, to return to the normal form of
the parent species; and this instability is considered to be a
distinctive peculiarity of all varieties, even of those occurring among
wild animals in a state of nature, and to constitute a provision for
preserving unchanged the originally created distinct species.</p>

<p>In the absence or scarcity of facts and observations as to <i>varieties</i>
occurring among wild animals, this argument has had great weight with
naturalists, and has led to a very general and somewhat prejudiced
belief in the stability of species. Equally general, however, is the
belief in what are called "permanent or true varieties,"&mdash;races of
animals which continually propagate their like, but which differ so
slightly (although constantly) from some other race, that the one is
considered to be a <i>variety</i> of the other. Which is the <i>variety</i> and
which the original <i>species</i>, there is generally no means of
determining, except in those rare cases in which the one race has been
known to produce an offspring unlike itself and resembling the other.
This, however, would seem quite incompatible with the "permanent
invariability of species," but the difficulty is overcome by assuming
that such varieties have strict limits, and can never again vary further
from the original type, although they may return to it, which, from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
analogy of the domesticated animals, is considered to be highly
probable, if not certainly proved.</p>

<p>It will be observed that this argument rests entirely on the assumption,
that <i>varieties</i> occurring in a state of nature are in all respects
analogous to or even identical with those of domestic animals, and are
governed by the same laws as regards their permanence or further
variation. But it is the object of the present paper to show that this
assumption is altogether false, that there is a general principle in
nature which will cause many <i>varieties</i> to survive the parent species,
and to give rise to successive variations departing further and further
from the original type, and which also produces, in domesticated
animals, the tendency of varieties to return to the parent form.</p>

<p>The life of wild animals is a struggle for existence. The full exertion
of all their faculties and all their energies is required to preserve
their own existence and provide for that of their infant offspring. The
possibility of procuring food during the least favourable seasons, and
of escaping the attacks of their most dangerous enemies, are the primary
conditions which determine the existence both of individuals and of
entire species. These conditions will also determine the population of a
species; and by a careful consideration of all the circumstances we may
be enabled to comprehend, and in some degree to explain, what at first
sight appears so inexplicable&mdash;the excessive abundance of some species,
while others closely allied to them are very rare.</p>

<p>The general proportion that must obtain between certain groups of
animals is readily seen. Large animals cannot be so abundant as small
ones; the carnivora must be less numerous than the herbivora; eagles and
lions can never be so plentiful as pigeons and antelopes; the wild asses
of the Tartarian deserts cannot equal in numbers the horses of the more
luxuriant prairies and pampas of America. The greater or less fecundity
of an animal is often considered to be one of the chief causes of its
abundance or scarcity; but a consideration of the facts will show us
that it really has little or nothing to do with the matter. Even the
least prolific of animals would increase rapidly if unchecked, whereas
it is evident that the animal population of the globe must be
stationary, or perhaps, through the influence of man, decreasing.
Fluctuations there may be; but permanent increase, except in restricted
localities, is almost impossible. For example, our own observation must
convince us that birds do not go on increasing every year in a
geometrical ratio, as they would do, were there not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> some powerful check
to their natural increase. Very few birds produce less than two young
ones each year, while many have six, eight, or ten; four will certainly
be below the average; and if we suppose that each pair produce young
only four times in their life, that will also be below the average,
supposing them not to die either by violence or want of food. Yet at
this rate how tremendous would be the increase in a few years from a
single pair! A simple calculation will show that in fifteen years each
pair of birds would have increased to nearly ten millions! whereas we
have no reason to believe that the number of the birds of any country
increases at all in fifteen or in one hundred and fifty years. With such
powers of increase the population must have reached its limits, and have
become stationary, in a very low years after the origin of each species.
It is evident, therefore, that each year an immense number of birds must
perish&mdash;as many in fact as are born; and as on the lowest calculation
the progeny are each year twice as numerous as their parents, it follows
that, whatever be the average number of individuals existing in any
given country, <i>twice that number must perish annually</i>,&mdash;a striking
result, but one which seems at least highly probable, and is perhaps
under rather than over the truth. It would therefore appear that, as far
as the continuance of the species and the keeping up the average number
of individuals are concerned, large broods are superfluous. On the
average all above <i>one</i> become food for hawks and kites, wild cats and
weasels, or perish of cold and hunger as winter comes on. This is
strikingly proved by the case of particular species; for we find that
their abundance in individuals bears no relation whatever to their
fertility in producing offspring. Perhaps the most remarkable instance
of an immense bird population is that of the passenger pigeon of the
United States, which lays only one, or at most two eggs, and is said to
rear generally but one young one. Why is this bird so extraordinarily
abundant, while others producing two or three times as many young are
much less plentiful? The explanation is not difficult. The food most
congenial to this species, and on which it thrives best, is abundantly
distributed over a very extensive region, offering such differences of
soil and climate, that in one part or another of the area the supply
never fails. The bird is capable of a very rapid and long-continued
flight, so that it can pass without fatigue over the whole of the
district it inhabits, and as soon as the supply of food begins to fail
in one place is able to discover a fresh feeding-ground. This example
strikingly shows us that the procuring a constant supply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> of wholesome
food is almost the sole condition requisite for ensuring the rapid
increase of a given species, since neither the limited fecundity, nor
the unrestrained attacks of birds of prey and of man are here sufficient
to check it. In no other birds are these peculiar circumstances so
strikingly combined. Either their food is more liable to failure, or
they have not sufficient power of wing to search for it over an
extensive area, or during some season of the year it becomes very
scarce, and less wholesome substitutes have to be found; and thus,
though more fertile in offspring, they can never increase beyond the
supply of food in the least favourable seasons. Many birds can only
exist by migrating, when their food becomes scarce, to regions
possessing a milder, or at least a different climate, though, as these
migrating birds are seldom excessively abundant, it is evident that the
countries they visit are still deficient in a constant and abundant
supply of wholesome food. Those whose organization does not permit them
to migrate when their food becomes periodically scarce, can never attain
a large population. This is probably the reason why woodpeckers are
scarce with us, while in the tropics they are among the most abundant of
solitary birds. Thus the house sparrow is more abundant than the
redbreast, because its food is more constant and plentiful,&mdash;seeds of
grasses being preserved during the winter, and our farm-yards and
stubble-fields furnishing an almost inexhaustible supply. Why, as a
general rule, are aquatic, and especially sea birds, very numerous in
individuals? Not because they are more prolific than others, generally
the contrary; but because their food never fails, the sea-shores and
river-banks daily swarming with a fresh supply of small mollusca and
crustacea. Exactly the same laws will apply to mammals. Wild cats are
prolific and have few enemies; why then are they never as abundant as
rabbits? The only intelligible answer is, that their supply of food is
more precarious. It appears evident, therefore, that so long as a
country remains physically unchanged, the numbers of its animal
population cannot materially increase. If one species does so, some
others requiring the same kind of food must diminish in proportion. The
numbers that die annually must be immense; and as the individual
existence of each animal depends upon itself, those that die must be the
weakest&mdash;the very young, the aged, and the diseased,&mdash;while those that
prolong their existence can only be the most perfect in health and
vigour&mdash;those who are best able to obtain food regularly, and avoid
their numerous enemies. It is, as we commenced by remarking, "a struggle
for existence," in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> which the weakest and least perfectly organized must
always succumb.</p>

<p>Now it is clear that what takes place among the individuals of a species
must also occur among the several allied species of a group,&mdash;viz. that
those which are best adapted to obtain a regular supply of food, and to
defend themselves against the attacks of their enemies and the
vicissitudes of the seasons, must necessarily obtain and preserve a
superiority in population; while those species which from some defect of
power or organization are the least capable of counteracting the
vicissitudes of food, supply, &amp;c., must diminish in numbers, and, in
extreme cases, become altogether extinct. Between these extremes the
species will present various degrees of capacity for ensuring the means
of preserving life; and it is thus we account for the abundance or
rarity of species. Our ignorance will generally prevent us from
accurately tracing the effects to their causes; but could we become
perfectly acquainted with the organization and habits of the various
species of animals, and could we measure the capacity of each for
performing the different acts necessary to its safety and existence
under all the varying circumstances by which it is surrounded, we might
be able even to calculate the proportionate abundance of individuals
which is the necessary result.</p>

<p>If now we have succeeded in establishing these two points&mdash;1st, <i>that
the animal population of a country is generally stationary, being kept
down by a periodical deficiency of food, and other checks</i>; and, 2nd,
<i>that the comparative abundance or scarcity of the individuals of the
several species is entirely due to their organization and resulting
habits, which, rendering it more difficult to procure a regular supply
of food and to provide for their personal safety in some cases than in
others, can only be balanced by a difference in the population which
have to exist in a given area</i>&mdash;we shall be in a condition to proceed to
the consideration of <i>varieties</i>, to which the preceding remarks have a
direct and very important application.</p>

<p>Most or perhaps all the variations from the typical form of a species
must have some definite effect, however slight, on the habits or
capacities of the individuals. Even a change of colour might, by
rendering them more or less distinguishable, affect their safety; a
greater or less development of hair might modify their habits. More
important changes, such as an increase in the power or dimensions of the
limbs or any of the external organs, would more or less affect their
mode of procuring food or the range of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> country which they inhabit. It
is also evident that most changes would affect, either favourably or
adversely, the powers of prolonging existence. An antelope with shorter
or weaker legs must necessarily suffer more from the attacks of the
feline carnivora; the passenger pigeon with less powerful wings would
sooner or later be affected in its powers of procuring a regular supply
of food; and in both cases the result must necessarily be a diminution
of the population of the modified species. If, on the other hand, any
species should produce a variety having slightly increased powers of
preserving existence, that variety must inevitably in time acquire a
superiority in numbers. These results must follow as surely as old age,
intemperance, or scarcity of food produce an increased mortality. In
both cases there may be many individual exceptions; but on the average
the rule will invariably be found to hold good. All varieties will
therefore fall into two classes&mdash;those which under the same conditions
would never reach the population of the parent species, and those which
would in time obtain and keep a numerical superiority. Now, let some
alteration of physical conditions occur in the district&mdash;a long period
of drought, a destruction of vegetation by locusts, the irruption of
some new carnivorous animal seeking "pastures new"&mdash;any change in fact
tending to render existence more difficult to the species in question,
and tasking its utmost powers to avoid complete extermination; it is
evident that, of all the individuals composing the species, those
forming the least numerous and most feebly organized variety would
suffer first, and, were the pressure severe, must soon become extinct.
The same causes continuing in action, the parent species would next
suffer, would gradually diminish in numbers, and with a recurrence of
similar unfavourable conditions might also become extinct. The superior
variety would then alone remain, and on a return to favourable
circumstances would rapidly increase in numbers and occupy the place of
the extinct species and variety.</p>

<p>The <i>variety</i> would now have replaced the <i>species</i>, of which it would
be a more perfectly developed and more highly organized form. It would
be in all respects better adapted to secure its safety, and to prolong
its individual existence and that of the race. Such a variety <i>could
not</i> return to the original form; for that form is an inferior one, and
could never compete with it for existence. Granted, therefore, a
"tendency" to reproduce the original type of the species, still the
variety must ever remain preponderant in numbers, and under adverse
physical conditions <i>again alone survive</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> But this new, improved, and
populous race might itself, in course of time, give rise to new
varieties, exhibiting several diverging modifications of form, any of
which, tending to increase the facilities for preserving existence,
must, by the same general law, in their turn become predominant. Here,
then, we have <i>progression and continued divergence</i> deduced from the
general laws which regulate the existence of animals in a state of
nature, and from the undisputed fact that varieties do frequently occur.
It is not, however, contended that this result would be invariable; a
change of physical conditions in the district might at times materially
modify it, rendering the race which had been the most capable of
supporting existence under the former conditions now the least so, and
even causing the extinction of the newer and, for a time, superior race,
while the old or parent species and its first inferior varieties
continued to flourish. Variations in unimportant parts might also occur,
having no perceptible effect on the life-preserving powers; and the
varieties so furnished might run a course parallel with the parent
species, either giving rise to further variations or returning to the
former type. All we argue for is, that certain varieties have a tendency
to maintain their existence longer than the original species, and this
tendency must make itself felt; for though the doctrine of chances or
averages can never be trusted to on a limited scale, yet, if applied to
high numbers, the results come nearer to what theory demands, and, as we
approach to an infinity of examples, become strictly accurate. Now the
scale on which nature works is so vast&mdash;the numbers of individuals and
periods of time with which she deals approach so near to infinity, that
any cause, however slight, and however liable to be veiled and
counteracted by accidental circumstances, must in the end produce its
full legitimate results.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to domesticated animals, and inquire how varieties
produced among them are affected by the principles here enunciated. The
essential difference in the condition of wild and domestic animals is
this,&mdash;that among the former, their well-being and very existence depend
upon the full exercise and healthy condition of all their senses and
physical powers, whereas, among the latter, these are only partially
exercised, and in some cases are absolutely unused. A wild animal has to
search, and often to labour, for every mouthful of food&mdash;to exercise
sight, hearing, and smell in seeking it, and in avoiding dangers, in
procuring shelter from the inclemency of the seasons, and in providing
for the subsistence and safety of its offspring. There is no muscle of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
its body that is not called into daily and hourly activity; there is no
sense or faculty that is not strengthened by continual exercise. The
domestic animal, on the other hand, has food provided for it, is
sheltered, and often confined, to guard it against the vicissitudes of
the seasons, is carefully secured from the attacks of its natural
enemies, and seldom even rears its young without human assistance. Half
of its senses and faculties are quite useless; and the other half are
but occasionally called into feeble exercise, while even its muscular
system is only irregularly called into action.</p>

<p>Now when a variety of such an animal occurs, having increased power or
capacity in any organ or sense, such increase is totally useless, is
never called into action, and may even exist without the animal ever
becoming aware of it. In the wild animal, on the contrary, all its
faculties and powers being brought into full action for the necessities
of existence, any increase becomes immediately available, is
strengthened by exercise, and must even slightly modify the food, the
habits, and the whole economy of the race. It creates as it were a new
animal, one of superior powers, and which will necessarily increase in
numbers and outlive those inferior to it.</p>

<p>Again, in the domesticated animal all variations have an equal chance of
continuance; and those which would decidedly render a wild animal unable
to compete with its fellows and continue its existence are no
disadvantage whatever in a state of domesticity. Our quickly fattening
pigs, short-legged sheep, pouter pigeons, and poodle dogs could never
have come into existence in a state of nature, because the very first
step towards such inferior forms would have led to the rapid extinction
of the race; still less could they now exist in competition with their
wild allies. The great speed but slight endurance of the race horse, the
unwieldy strength of the ploughman's team, would both be useless in a
state of nature. If turned wild on the pampas, such animals would
probably soon become extinct, or under favourable circumstances might
each lose those extreme qualities which would never be called into
action, and in a few generations would revert to a common type, which
must be that in which the various powers and faculties are so
proportioned to each other as to be best adapted to procure food and
secure safety,&mdash;that in which by the full exercise of every part of his
organization the animal can alone continue to live. Domestic varieties,
when turned wild, <i>must</i> return to something near the type of the
original wild stock, <i>or become altogether extinct</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>We see, then, that no inferences as to varieties in a state of nature
can be deduced from the observation of those occurring among domestic
animals. The two are so much opposed to each other in every circumstance
of their existence, that what applies to the one is almost sure not to
apply to the other. Domestic animals are abnormal, irregular,
artificial; they are subject to varieties which never occur and never
can occur in a state of nature: their very existence depends altogether
on human care; so far are many of them removed from that just proportion
of faculties, that true balance of organization, by means of which alone
an animal left to its own resources can preserve its existence and
continue its race.</p>

<p>The hypothesis of Lamarck&mdash;that progressive changes in species have been
produced by the attempts of animals to increase the development of their
own organs, and thus modify their structure and habits&mdash;has been
repeatedly and easily refuted by all writers on the subject of varieties
and species, and it seems to have been considered that when this was
done the whole question has been finally settled; but the view here
developed renders such an hypothesis quite unnecessary, by showing that
similar results must be produced by the action of principles constantly
at work in nature. The powerful retractile talons of the falcon- and the
cat-tribes have not been produced or increased by the volition of those
animals; but among the different varieties which occurred in the earlier
and less highly organized forms of these groups, <i>those always survived
longest which had the greatest facilities for seizing their prey</i>.
Neither did the giraffe acquire its long neck by desiring to reach the
foliage of the more lofty shrubs, and constantly stretching its neck for
the purpose, but because any varieties which occurred among its
antitypes with a longer neck than usual <i>at once secured a fresh range
of pasture over the same ground as their shorter-necked companions, and
on the first scarcity of food were thereby enabled to outlive them</i>.
Even the peculiar colours of many animals, especially insects, so
closely resembling the soil or the leaves or the trunks on which they
habitually reside, are explained on the same principle; for though in
the course of ages varieties of many tints may have occurred, <i>yet those
races having colours best adapted to concealment from their enemies
would inevitably survive the longest</i>. We have also here an acting cause
to account for that balance so often observed in nature,&mdash;a deficiency
in one set of organs always being compensated by an increased
development of some others&mdash;powerful wings accompanying weak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> feet, or
great velocity making up for the absence of defensive weapons; for it
has been shown that all varieties in which an unbalanced deficiency
occurred could not long continue their existence. The action of this
principle is exactly like that of the centrifugal governor of the steam
engine, which checks and corrects any irregularities almost before they
become evident; and in like manner no unbalanced deficiency in the
animal kingdom can ever reach any conspicuous magnitude, because it
would make itself felt at the very first step, by rendering existence
difficult and extinction almost sure soon to follow. An origin such as
is here advocated will also agree with the peculiar character of the
modifications of form and structure which obtain in organized
beings&mdash;the many lines of divergence from a central type, the increasing
efficiency and power of a particular organ through a succession of
allied species, and the remarkable persistence of unimportant parts such
as colour, texture of plumage and hair, form of horns or crests, through
a series of species differing considerably in more essential characters.
It also furnishes us with a reason for that "more specialized structure"
which Professor Owen states to be a characteristic of recent compared
with extinct forms, and which would evidently be the result of the
progressive modification of any organ applied to a special purpose in
the animal economy.</p>

<p>We believe we have now shown that there is a tendency in nature to the
continued progression of certain classes of <i>varieties</i> further and
further from the original type&mdash;a progression to which there appears no
reason to assign any definite limits&mdash;and that the same principle which
produces this result in a state of nature will also explain why domestic
varieties have a tendency to revert to the original type. This
progression, by minute steps, in various directions, but always checked
and balanced by the necessary conditions, subject to which alone
existence can be preserved, may, it is believed, be followed out so as
to agree with all the phenomena presented by organized beings, their
extinction and succession in past ages, and all the extraordinary
modifications of form, instinct, and habits which they exhibit.</p>

<p class="first">The dissection of the Cetacea, and more especially of the larger kinds,
is attended with great difficulty, and not unfrequently entails heavy
expenses on those who attempt it. For these reasons I have thought that
zoologists might be pleased to have, even now, submitted to them the
results of numerous dissections made many years ago, when, not stinted
in means, and having the aid of excellent assistants, I attempted the
dissection even of the gigantic Arctic Rorqual, the largest, perhaps, of
all living beings. Certain of the details have been from time to time
laid before the public, but in an extremely scattered and incomplete
form, and without the illustrations (artistic), which explain so much
better than any verbal description. The greater part is still before me
in manuscript. It is my intention in the following contributions to
endeavour to connect them together, adding to those already published
many facts I find in MSS. The original drawings, made by my brother and
by Messrs. Edward Forbes and Henry Goodsir (who were at that time my
students and assistants), are still in my possession.</p>

<p><i>Determination of Species.</i>&mdash;The determination of species as regards the
<i>Cetacea</i> is one of much difficulty; Cuvier met this difficulty by an
appeal to anatomy. The number of vertebr&aelig; composing the vertebral column
(exclusive of the cephalic) seemed to me a tolerably secure guide in the
determination of species,&mdash;being aware, however, that some doubted the
method, believing that the number of the vertebr&aelig; might vary, first,
with the individual, secondly with the age of the specimen. I still
continue to be of my original opinion, that the number of vertebr&aelig;
comprising the vertebral column, properly so called, may safely be
trusted in determining the species of the Cetacea; and with this view I
drew up the following Table, excepting from it the genus <i>Dugong</i>, which
I have never considered to be a Cetacean:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>In a late number of the 'Bulletins of the Royal Academy of Brussels' I
find some valuable remarks in respect of these points by M. Van Beneden.
He praises, and deservedly, no doubt, the exertions of M. Eschricht to
collect a proper Museum of the Cetacea. It appears, according to M.
Eschricht, that at no age whatever do we find in true whales (meaning, I
presume, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> <i>Mysticetus borealis</i> and <i>australis</i>) any distinct
vertebr&aelig; in the cervical region as in other mammals. A fusion of all
into one bone or cartilage seems to take place even in the youngest
f&oelig;tus. In the f&oelig;tus examined by me of this species (a specimen
removed from the uterus of a true <i>Mysticetus</i> killed in the Greenland
seas), I do not recollect the precise appearance of the cervical
vertebr&aelig;; but the skeleton is in existence, and shall be referred to. To
the skeleton of the Rorqual now in the Museum at Antwerp, and which
seems to me of the same species as the one I dissected in Scotland (and
of which the skeleton, prepared with infinite care by my brother and
myself, was presented by me to the Town Council of Edinburgh, and is now
preserved in the Zoological Gardens of the same city), he gives the
following vertebr&aelig;:&mdash;</p>

<p>The specimen was that of a young animal, and of the same species,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> I
believe, as the one described by Mr. Hunter and Fabricius; it is a
distinct species, and not merely the young of the Great Rorqual.</p>

<p>I shall return to the Dugong, as not being a Cetacean, in a future
Section: its skeleton has been examined in a masterly way by De
Blainville, an anatomist and observer of the highest order, since the
time I wrote and published my Memoir on the Dugong.</p>

<p>The first great step in the anatomy of the Cetacea is unquestionably due
to Cuvier; but his dissections were almost confined to the genus
<i>Delphinus</i>, or the common Porpoise of our coasts. I repeated all his
dissections, and found them, as they almost always were, scrupulously
exact; but when I came to examine Cetacea with whalebone instead of
teeth, I was surprised to find how different, in fact, the anatomy of
the two great families was. Scarcely in any great natural family do we
find Cuvier's favourite theory of anatomical and physiological
co-relations so entirely at fault as in the Cetacea. The teeth or
whalebone, as natural-history characters, lead to no results; the whole
structure of the interior defies all <i>&agrave;-priori</i> reasoning. The brain in
whalebone-whales does not fill the interior of the cranium; so that the
capacity of the one is no measure of the solid bulk of the other. Their
food is various, having no relation to the teeth or buccal appendages;
vascular structures surround the spinal marrow, and extend in the
<i>Bal&aelig;nopter&aelig;</i> into the cavity of the cranium, which seem to be without
any analogy in other mammals, or, at the least, a very obscure one, and
whose functions are wholly unknown.</p>

<p>Cetacea might with some propriety be divided into whales with whalebone,
and whales with teeth. Those with whalebone have rudimentary teeth in
both jaws in the f&oelig;tal state. Fossil Cetacea exist, and they seem to
have been of both kinds, but, no doubt, were generically and
specifically distinct from the recent. Judging from the remains of those
I have seen, I am inclined to think that those with teeth were of a
stronger and firmer build in the skeleton than those called recent; that
the neck was longer, and the caudal portion of the column shorter than
in the recent kinds, and that they approached the Saurians in form.
There is a remarkable want of symmetry in the crania of some of the
Cetacea; but most remarkable is the cranium of the Narwhal. Of this fact
I have already spoken, in the article published in the Transactions of
the Royal Society of Edinburgh.</p>

<p><i>Delphinus Phoc&aelig;na. Dissection of a small Cetacean sent to me from
Orkney in the month of May 1835.</i>&mdash;This species is said to abound on the
coasts, and to furnish a kind of fishery to the inhabitants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> On
dissection we found 81 vertebr&aelig;, exclusive of the cephalic. The species
must be quite distinct from those previously and subsequently examined
by myself and many others, in which the number of vertebr&aelig; ranged from
61 to 66. It is also, I think, distinct from the specimen I saw in Dr.
R. Hunter's Museum in Glasgow, in which the number of vertebr&aelig; was 90,
exclusive of the cephalic in all the cases. Thus it stands with regard
to the Cetacea called Porpoises and Dolphins.</p>

<p>In certain species of <i>Delphinus</i> the vertical column is composed of 61
vertebr&aelig;, in others of 65, in others of 66, in others of 81, in others
of 90.</p>

<p>The specimen I now describe was, no doubt, that of a young animal; and
the skeleton was prepared, consequently, as a natural one. This method
has the advantage of security against the loss of any important osseous
structures, which too frequently happens when the bones require to be
macerated. The bones contained little oil, and weighed, head included,
only 7&frac14; lbs.; the whole animal, when entire, weighed 14 stone, or 196
lbs.; the skeleton therefore was about a twenty-fourth part of the whole
weight. It was a female. The external nostrils terminated in a single
orifice of a semilunar shape, with the concavity turned towards the
snout. Measurements of young animals have not the importance of those of
the adult; but I give them here because I think that the specimen,
although young, had nearly attained its full growth:&mdash;</p>

<p>From the notes taken at the time, I find that my brother remarks that
the Dolphin of Orkney differed a good deal in shape from those found in
the Forth and seas in the South of Scotland. There were, moreover, 16
more vertebr&aelig; than in the skeleton of the Common Porpoise of authors.
The teeth generally weighed 2&frac12; grains each.</p>

<p>Further, the muscles of the tongue, intrinsic as well as extrinsic, were
extremely well developed. The isthmus faucium was 3 inches long. All
this part was extremely glandular. A well-marked muscular gullet
followed, composed of two layers of muscular fibres,&mdash;one circular
internally, and one longitudinal externally. These latter sent a slip to
the base of the aryt&aelig;noid cartilages. The mucous membrane of the gullet
had no true epidermic covering, and in this respect differed remarkably
from the first gastric compartment, from which a cuticular lining could
be peeled off, as strong as that from the sole of the foot in man. The
larynx presented that organization so well described by the illustrious
Cuvier, and which I believe to be peculiar to the whales with teeth. It
differs very much, as I explained long ago, in its arrangement from that
of Whalebone Whales,&mdash;a fact of which I think Cuvier was not aware. The
cricoid cartilage was imperfect in form; the hyo-epiglottic muscles very
strong. The proper aryt&aelig;noid were present, and strong, but did not
extend so high as in man; the thyro-aryt&aelig;noid muscles were very fully
developed. In the interior of the larynx there were no projections nor
ventricles, no cuneiform cartilages, nor cornicula laryngis. The rings
of the trachea formed complete circles.</p>

<p><i>Stomach.</i>&mdash;The cuticular lining is limited to the first cavity or
compartment. It is in the second compartment that is found the curious
glandular arrangement first, I believe, described by me in the
'Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.' This structure is most
probably not limited to the second compartment. There are four distinct
compartments in the stomach of this animal. A dilated duodenum follows,
6 inches in length. It is possible that this may have been in some
instances mistaken for a stomach. The valvul&aelig; conniventes commence with
the jejunum; these are longitudinal, and extend to within about 6 inches
of the anus, terminating at a point where the intestine seems enlarged.
The length of the intestines, large and small, was 90 feet;
circumference generally about 2 inches. Thousands and tens of thousands
of parasitical worms were found in the stomach, but none in the
intestine. In the stomach also we found four mandibles of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> the
cuttlefish, but no remains of anything in the intestines, and no
parasites.</p>

<p><i>Heart and Vessels.</i>&mdash;The heart weighed exactly one pound. The
Eustachian valve was small, that of Thebesius imperfect. The aorta
proceeded for about 3 inches of its course before giving off any
branches. At a point corresponding to the 15th or 16th lumbar vertebra
the vessel divided into the common iliacs. The <i>art. sacri media</i>, its
continuation, continued its course protected by the V-bones, and giving
off branches corresponding to the intervertebral spaces.</p>

<p><i>Brain and Nervous System.</i>&mdash;The erectile tissue surrounding the spinal
cord and origin of the spinal nerves in the Cetacea did not extend into
the interior of the cranium. The entire encephalic mass weighed 2&frac12;
lbs.: cerebrum, 2 lbs.; cerebellum, &frac14;; pons and medulla, &frac14; = 2&frac12;.
Compared with a drawing of Camper of the <i>Delphinus Phoc&aelig;na</i>, the brain
was found to differ remarkably, in being much broader in the line of the
middle and posterior lobes. In no animal did I ever find the fibrous
structure of the brain so well marked; and this extended to the
cerebellum<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>. I give here some measurements of the brain, which may be
of use to future observers. The brain is short from before backwards,
but broad transversely:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Nerves.</i>&mdash;The 7th pair was found to be unexpectedly large and firm,
including both portions. The anterior roots of the spinal nerves were
far more numerous than the posterior or dorsal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Muscles.</i>&mdash;The panniculus carnosus, strong and fleshy, extended nearly
over the whole trunk. The recti abdominis were powerful, and attached
inferiorly in this way:&mdash;A portion runs to the pelvic bones; a much
stronger to a strong aponeurosis, situated between the anus and the root
of the tail.</p>

<p>The erector muscles of the spine (sacrolumbalis, longissimus dorsi and
multifidus spin&aelig;) weighed fully 16 lbs. They had but slender costal
attachments; but their spinal (small delicate tendons) were innumerable.
The scaleni were very large; and the vessels held the same relation to
them as in man. The serratus magnus was comparatively small. The larger
rhomboid had no spinal attachment; the minor rhomboid seemed to be the
larger of the two. The pectorals were comparatively small. The adipose
tissue appeared to be wholly confined to the subcutaneous region. The
muscles were of a deep brown colour, full of blood, with a short, dark,
and well-flavoured fibre: when cooked, they had a strong resemblance in
flavour and taste to the flesh of the hare.</p>


<p class="center">Part II. <span class="smcap">The Bal&aelig;na Whales, or Whales with Whalebone.</span></p>

<p>In February 1834 a young whale of the family of Bal&aelig;na Whales was caught
near the Queensferry, in the Firth of Forth. One much larger had been
seen some time before, but escaped. I purchased it for dissection,
although I was aware that it was impossible for me, during the hurry of
the winter session, to devote much time to it. But I had able assistants
(Mr. Henry Goodsir, Mr. Edward Forbes, and my brother), from whom I
expected a good deal of aid. Some very beautiful drawings of this whale,
made for me by Mr. Edward Forbes and by my brother, are still in my
possession.</p>

<p>It was easy to see, by the dorsal fin and by the numerous plaits or
folds on the abdominal surface of the throat and chest, before any
dissection, that the specimen was a young Bal&aelig;nopterous whale, differing
in a great many points from the true whale or <i>Mysticetus</i>: for, 1st,
the form of the head was entirely different; 2nd, it had a dorsal fin;
and, 3rd, occupying the lower surface of the throat and thorax were
numerous folds of the integuments. To this class of whales I have been
in the habit of giving the name of Rorqual, to distinguish them from the
other class of Whalebone Whales, the <i>Mysticetus</i> both <i>borealis</i> and
<i>australis</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>It appears from my notes, that at that time M. G. Cuvier considered the
species I now describe as identical with the Great Rorqual I had
described about two years previously; but I felt convinced then, as now,
that they form distinct species, and in this opinion some continental
anatomists seem to coincide.</p>

<p>Being persuaded that there was some inaccuracy in former drawings of the
species, I had the specimen suspended and drawn with great care by Mr.
Edward Forbes. This position explained the mechanism of the mouth,
showing its great size, even in the short Bal&aelig;na Whales; its great
capacity in the <i>Mysticetus</i> had never been doubted.</p>

<p>As to the species, the conclusion I arrived at was, that the specimen
belonged to that termed by Fabricius <i>rostrata</i>, and that individuals of
the species had been seen by John Hunter, Sir James Watson, and
Fabricius.</p>

<p>These differences must be specific.</p>

<p>At the extremity of the snout in either jaw there were 8 strong
bristles, being the only vestiges of hair found on the external surface.
The mouth was of great size; the tongue large and tolerably free, and of
a pale rose or vermilion colour. The baleen, where deepest, measured
about 4 inches; there were 370 plates on each side; but anteriorly and
posteriorly these plates were reduced to mere bristles.</p>

<p>The isthmus faucium allowed the closed hand to pass through it; through
this isthmus I do not believe that any water ever passes into the
pharynx, unless it be accidentally, as in man. The "spout" of the
Whalebone Whale is composed, no doubt, of the pulmonary vapour, and not
of any water received into the pharynx from the mouth.</p>

<p>The stomach seemed composed of five compartments externally, but
presented only four when laid open, the fifth being manifestly the
duodenum. In the intestines no remains of food were found, but abundance
of intestinal worms, and a substance strongly resembling the human
meconium. There was an ilio-c&aelig;cal valve as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> distinct as in man. In the
rectum the folds of the mucous membrane were transverse.</p>

<p><i>Organs of Respiration</i>.&mdash;The external nostrils were double; and the
cavities of the nostrils provided with the remarkable cartilages and
muscular apparatus I discovered and described in the anatomy of the
Great Rorqual. In this specimen they were about 4 inches in length, but
of as many feet in the large Rorqual. The mode of breathing in the
Rorquals does not differ much from that in man, with the exception of
the apparatus of the protruding cartilages, which in man are
rudimentary.</p>

<p>The <i>Olfactory Nerves</i> were quite as large as in other mammals; and in
this respect the Bal&aelig;na Whales are quite unlike the Dolphins<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>.</p>

<p>The trachea communicated, near its upper part, with a sac or pouch; the
lungs were each composed of a single lobe. The rings of the trachea were
mostly deficient anteriorly. In the heart the f&oelig;tal arrangements had
wholly disappeared. The dura mater seemed divisible into three layers,
the external being vascular. A remarkable vascular substance connected
with this layer covers the back part of the brain and cerebellum,
extending into the spinal canal, and even into the chest. At the base of
the brain the vascular plexus was about 2 inches in thickness. It is, as
is well known, a sort of erectile tissue, of whose functions we are
wholly ignorant. It is not confined to this course, but extends to the
neck, and, passing through the foramina intervertebralia, fills the
intercostal spaces exterior to the pleura.</p>

<p>There was evidently a canal in the centre of the spinal marrow. Wherever
the nerves of the lungs and stomach were traced, they terminated in
loops. We did not observe in the Great Rorqual any tracheal pouch like
that in the smaller; but it may have escaped notice: if absent in the
Great Rorqual, it would be another proof of the distinctness of the
species.</p>

<p>The doubts raised by M. St. Hilaire, as to the Whale being a mammal in
the true sense of the term, were set aside long ago by an appeal to
facts. The young of the Whale tribe suckle like the young of all
mammals; nevertheless I showed, in 1834, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> the lactiferous glands in
the <i>Bal&aelig;nopter&aelig;</i> differ in structure from the same organs in most
mammals.</p>

<p>I do not find in my notes anything to add to the description of the
Great Rorqual already published in the 'Transactions of the Royal
Society of Edinburgh' for 1827, to which I beg leave to refer the
reader.</p>

<p>A single remark must be added regarding the nature of the vascular
plexus which, in the Cetacea, surrounds the spinal marrow, and extends
into the chest. On selecting the artery which seemed to form the plexus,
which was, if I rightly recollect, in this instance an intercostal
artery, and dissecting it under water, I found, to my surprise, that the
artery, so long as I followed it, never gave off any branches, but
continued of the same calibre throughout, making innumerable
flexuosities or turnings. Thus, on a plexiform mass of this kind being
cut across, the first impression is, that a great number of arterial
branches or arteries have been divided, whilst in fact the entire plexus
seems to be formed of one artery.</p>

<p>As was to be expected of animals so much withdrawn from human
observation, there is but little to say on the natural history of the
Cetacea properly so called. Their food, no doubt, is various, and seems
to have little or no relation to the character of their dentition. The
enormous Cachalot, with its vast teeth implanted only in one jaw, is
generally understood to prey chiefly on the Cuttlefish. The food of the
true Whale, or <i>Mysticetus</i>, is well known to be the Clio and other
smaller Mollusca, with which certain regions of the ocean abound; the
same, or similar, is probably the food of the more active and restless
Rorquals, found in both hemispheres. The Dolphins, or Toothed Whales,
generally prey, no doubt, on fishes of various kinds; yet, even as
regards these, it has been proved by my esteemed friend, the late Mr.
Henry Goodsir, that some of the largest, following in the wake of the
herring shoals, prey not on these, but on the various microscopic food
(the Entomostraca and other marine animals) which I was the first to
prove to be the natural food of many excellent gregarious freshwater
fish, as the Vendace, Early Loch Leven Trout, the Brown Trout of the
Highland and Scottish lakes generally, and of the Herring itself<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>. It
is scarcely necessary to add, that the complex apparatus connected with
the exterior<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> nostrils of the Dolphins is wholly wanting in the Bal&aelig;na
Whales,&mdash;a fact of which M. Cuvier was not aware when he wrote his
celebrated Treatise on Comparative Anatomy.</p>

<p><i>Appendix</i>.&mdash;Since writing the above, I have received an answer to a
letter I addressed to my friend, John Goodsir, Esq., Professor of
Anatomy in the University of Edinburgh. The request contained in my
letter to Mr. Goodsir was, to examine for me the skeleton of a f&oelig;tal
<i>Mysticetus</i> now in the University Museum. The f&oelig;tus from which this
skeleton was prepared was removed from the uterus of the mother, killed
in the North Seas by the seamen of a whaling ship, by one of my former
students, Mr. R. Auld, who presented the specimen to me. The point at
issue was the composition of the cervical vertebr&aelig; in the true or
Greenland Whale, the <i>Bal&aelig;na Mysticetus</i>. M. Van Beneden, to whose
memoir I have referred in the commencement of this, says, on the
authority of Eschricht, that at no age whatever do we find in true
Whales (meaning, I presume, the <i>Mysticetus borealis</i> and <i>australis</i>)
any distinct vertebr&aelig; in the cervical region, as in other mammals. A
fusion of all into one bone or cartilage seems to take place even in the
youngest f&oelig;tus. Now, I had enjoyed the rare opportunity of dissecting
the f&oelig;tus of the <i>Mysticetus</i>, and I knew that the skeleton, prepared
with the greatest care, was still preserved in the Museum of the
University of Edinburgh. I wrote to Mr. Goodsir to re-examine this point
for me, for I did not find in my notes any confirmation of the
observations of Eschricht. Mr. Goodsir's reply to my note is as
follows:&mdash;</p>


<p class="quotsig">
"University, Edinburgh,<br />
Sept. 30, 1857.</p>

<p class="first">"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>"In the skeleton of the f&oelig;tal <i>Mysticetus</i> now in the University
Museum, the bodies of the axis and atlas have shrivelled up
together, having evidently consisted of cartilage only; but the
bodies of the five posterior cervical vertebr&aelig; are beautifully
distinct, having well-formed osseous centres, which give them more
of the configuration of the succeeding vertebral bodies than they
present in their compressed form in the adult.</p>

<p>"The neural arches in the cervical region of this skeleton are five
in number; the two anterior, which are distinctly those of the atlas
and axis, have an osseous nodule on each side, where the transverse
processes pass off. The third arch belongs to the third vertebra,
the fourth and fifth to the sixth and seventh. These three arches
are cartilaginous, and present no osseous centres. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> is impossible
to determine from the preparation whether the arches of the fourth
and fifth vertebr&aelig; had been cut away in dissecting the parts, or
whether they have shrivelled up in drying; but as the skeleton was
very carefully prepared, and as these two arches are deficient (at
least laterally) in the adult <i>Mysticetus</i>, I presume that the
cartilaginous matrices were at least extremely delicate in the
f&oelig;tus.</p>

<p>"I believe I have stated all the facts, afforded by this skeleton,
which bear upon your questions. They appear to me to afford no
support to the views to which they refer.</p>

<p class="quotsig">
"Yours very sincerely,<br />
(Signed)  "<span class="smcap">John Goodsir</span>."<br />
</p>


<p>The conclusion I arrived at is this,&mdash;that the actual number of cervical
vertebr&aelig; in the <i>Mysticetus</i> is, as in most other mammals, seven, and
that, notwithstanding their earlier fusion, they are originally quite
distinct.</p>

<p class="first">"In natural history my collection is advancing, especially in skins and
skeletons of birds. I am collecting skulls of all the domesticated
animals, and skeletons of the sheep and goats. I have got a few fish,
including a prettily-marked <i>Diodon</i> or <i>Tetraodon</i>, probably new, and a
<i>Myletes</i> which I did not meet with formerly. The <i>Silurid&aelig;</i> are the
most abundant fishes; and one species closely resembles the
<i>Hypophthalmus</i>, figured by R&uuml;ppell in his 'Fishes of the Nile and Red
Sea.' I have not met with another Polypterus. I shall get a
<i>Lepidosiren</i> in the river, and have heard of an electrical fish, I
believe a <i>Malopteruris</i>, such as I formerly found. I enclose two scales
of a fish which is said to grow to the length of 5 feet, but of which I
have specimens half that size only,&mdash;also a sketch of a curious fish
2&frac12; feet, which I put into spirits; it has neither ventral nor anal
fins, a very peculiar caudal, and a slender head, while the dorsal
extends along the whole back; eyes very small; teeth numerous and hard,
but not sharp." He adds, in a postscript, that he had got the
<i>Lepidosiren</i>. He had collected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> 700 species of plants, and numerous
fine fruits, which he says "will rejoice Sir William Hooker's heart."</p>

<p>Dr. Baikie's postscript, however, mentions that his vessel had been
wrecked about twelve miles above Lagos, and that she sunk in a few
minutes after she struck. He does not say what was the fate of his
collections, but states that all the party had fever from fatigue and
sleeping in swamps after the wreck.&mdash;J. R.</p>

<p class="first">This Collection of Hymenoptera is the most important contribution which
has been made to the Aculeata through the exertions of Mr. Wallace; in
point of geographical distribution, it adds much to our knowledge. In
the Aru, Key, and neighbouring islands, we meet with the extreme range
of the Australian insect-fauna; and as might be expected, it is found
amongst the Vespidious Group, and in one or two instances in the
Formicid&aelig;. The latter, being frequently conveyed from one island to
another, can perhaps scarcely be considered indicative of natural
geographical distribution. Of the forty-six species of the Formicidous
Group, only six were previously known to science. Of the genus
<i>Podomyrma</i> here established, one species only, from Adelaide, was
previously known; it is one of the most distinct and remarkable genera
in the family. The <i>Pompilid&aelig;</i> are species of great beauty, some closely
resembling those of Australia in the banding and maculation of their
wings; amongst the <i>Vespid&aelig;</i> will be found some of the most elegant and
beautiful forms in the whole of that protean family of Hymenoptera.</p>

<p>The <i>Male</i> of this fine species closely resembles the female; it is
black, with a transverse spot above the insertion of the antenn&aelig;, an
abbreviated narrow line behind the eyes, another on the lower margin of
their emargination; the scape in front and the clypeus yellow, the
latter notched at its apex; a minute yellow spot at the base of the

ferruginous; the basal joint of the intermediate and posterior tarsi
dusky; the intermediate femora deeply excavated or hollowed beneath; the
prothorax yellow above; the metathorax truncate, transversely striated
with several minute teeth on the lateral margins; the wings hyaline,
tinted with yellow, their apical margins slightly clouded; the apical
margins of all the segments of the abdomen bordered with yellow, that on
the first segment narrowest. The only particulars in which the female
apparently differs from Saussure's description, is that the second
fascia on the abdomen is <i>widest at the sides</i>, and there are <i>three
little teeth</i> on each side of the margins of the metathorax.</p>

<p>Our example of this species slightly differs in coloration from the
description of Saussure. He says, "black, with the vertex, the front,
the prothorax, and the border of all the segments of the abdomen, except
the first, yellow; the wings yellow;" in the Aru specimen, the sinus of
the eyes, a spot above the clypeus, a reversed crescent-shaped spot
crossing the ocelli, two oblique spots behind them, and a broad elongate
stripe behind the eyes yellow. These slight differences cannot
characterize more than a variety; in every other particular they exactly
correspond.</p>

<p class="read">[Read December 16th, 1858.]</p>


<p class="first">In the month of June last, my friend Professor Guibourt, of Paris, laid
before the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> some account of a remarkable
substance called <i>Tr&eacute;hala</i>, the cocoon of a Curculionidous insect found
in Persia, where, as well as in other parts of the East, it enjoys some
celebrity as the basis of a mucilaginous drink administered to the sick.</p>

<p>Specimens of this substance, as well as of another insect-product of
Persia, together with the insects themselves, were presented a few years
ago to the British Museum by W. K. Loftus, Esq., who obtained them while
engaged by the British Government on the question of the Turco-Persian
boundaries.</p>

<p>The precise determination of the species of these insects being a matter
of doubt, they have at my request been lately examined by M. Jekel, of
Paris, an entomologist with whom the family of <i>Curculionid&aelig;</i> has long
been an especial study. One of these insects M. Jekel has identified
with a species of wide distribution; the other proving undescribed, he
has drawn up a description of it, which, accompanied by a figure, I have
the honour to lay before the Linnean Society. To this, I venture to add
a few observations upon the productions to which I have alluded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>The first of these is <i>Tr&eacute;hala</i> or <i>Tricala</i>, under which name it formed
part of the Collection of Materia Medica sent by M. Della Sudda, of
Constantinople, to the Paris Exhibition of 1855, and since deposited in
the Ecole de Pharmacie in Paris.</p>

<p><i>Tr&eacute;hala</i> (fig. 2) consists of cocoons of an ovoid or globular form,
about &frac34; of an inch in length; their inner surface is composed of a
smooth, hard, dusky layer, external to which is a thick, rough,
tuberculated coating of a greyish-white colour and earthy appearance.
Some of the cocoons have attached to them the remains of the tomentose
stalk of the plant upon which they were formed; others have portions of
a tomentose spiny leaf built into them; and, more rarely, one finds
portions of the flowering heads of the plant, a species of <i>Echinops</i>,
similarly enclosed. Many of the cocoons are open at one end and empty;
others have a longitudinal aperture, originally closed by the stalk of
the plant, and still contain the insect; a few are entirely closed.
Specimens of this insect, extracted from the cocoons sent to Paris, were
examined in 1856 by my friend Mr. W. Wilson Saunders, who pronounced
them to be <i>Larinus maculatus</i> of Faldermann,&mdash;a determination also
arrived at by M. Jekel from specimens presented by Mr. Loftus to the
British Museum. Respecting these latter, one of which is represented in
fig. 1, M. Jekel makes the following remarks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="define">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Larinus maculatus</span>, <i>Faldermann, Faun. Transcauc.</i> ii. p. 228, 449,

p. 112 et vii. 2. p. 7.&mdash;<i>Hochhuth, Bull. Moscou</i>, 1847, No. 2. p.

<p>"Var. <ins class="correction" title="Greek: gamma">&gamma;</ins>. <i>Larin. Onopordinis</i>, Sch. <i>loc. cit.</i> iii. p.
111 (excl. synon.).</p>

<p>"Of this species, Mr. Loftus captured several specimens, all of
small size: from some of them the pollinosity had been rubbed off,
as is represented in the figure by Mr. Ford (<i>vide</i> fig. 1), which
shows only a part of the inferior layer of tomentum and the greyish
ground of the dorsal and lateral macul&aelig;; the latter, being the most
densely coloured in fresh specimens, are always the most persistent.
These belong to Sch&ouml;nherr's var. <ins class="correction" title="Greek: gamma">&gamma;</ins>, which that author
formerly regarded as the <i>Larinus Onopordinis</i>, Fabr. Others of Mr.
Loftus's specimens, which are very fresh, belong to var. <ins class="correction" title="Greek: beta">&beta;</ins>; none to the typical variety, which is often larger in size.</p>

<p>"This species has a very extended habitat: I have received it from
European Turkey (Frivaldski), Beyrouth, Caucasus, Persia (Dupont),
&amp;c. &amp;c.; and it is recorded by Sch&ouml;nherr as also found in Barbary
and Portugal.</p>

<p>"This is the insect which proceeds from the rough chalky-looking
nidus figured by Mr. Ford. (<i>Vide</i> fig. 2.)" </p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>The entomological question being so far disposed of, I may be permitted
a few remarks upon the properties which have obtained for <i>Tr&eacute;hala</i> a
place among drugs and dietetic substances.</p>

<p>The first author who gives any account of the substance is Father Ange,
who, in his 'Pharmacop&oelig;a Persica<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a>,' describes it in the following
terms:&mdash;"Est autem istud medicamentum veluti <i>tragea</i> ex nucleo pistacii
integro confecta; nam revera saccharum istud exterius corrugatum et
agglomeratum adh&aelig;ret cuidam nucleo, in quo non fructus, sed vermiculus
quidam nigricans Persice <i>C-hezoukek</i> bombycis instar reconditur et
moritur."</p>

<p>Father Ange also states that the substance is called in Persian <i>Schakar
tigal</i> <img src="images/image186a.png" alt="Persian script" title="Persian script" />,
literally <i>Sugar of nests</i>; but his Arabic
names, <i>Schakar el ma-ascher</i> <img src="images/image186b.png" alt="Arabic script" title="Arabic script" /> and <i>Saccar el aschaar</i>,
apply to an entirely different substance, namely to a saccharine matter
exuded, after the punctures of an insect, from the stems of <i>Calotropis
procera</i>, R. Br.<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>, of which plant he gives a quaint but tolerably
characteristic description.</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus, who obtained the specimens which he presented to the British
Museum, at Kirrind in Persia, in September, 1851, gives as the Persian
name of the cocoons <i>Shek roukeh</i>&mdash;a term, probably, the same as the
"<i>C-hezoukek</i>" (a misprint?) of Father Ange, but the signification of
which I have not been able to discover.</p>

<p>Another notice of the same substance, with a figure, is briefly given in
Dr. Honigberger's 'Thirty-five Years in the East' (Lond. 1852, vol. ii.
pp. 305-6), where we read that <i>Manna teeghul</i> or <i>Shukure teeghal</i>,
which are certain insect-nests of a hard texture, rough on the outside,
smooth within, about half an inch in length, and of a whitish colour,
are imported into Lahore from Hindostan.</p>

<p>M. Bourlier published in 1857 an interesting note on the same
substance<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a>, which has been followed by M. Guibourt's communication<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> to
the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences, and still later by a memoir on the chemical
history of Tr&eacute;hala, by M. Marcellin Berthelot, also presented to the
Academy<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a>.</p>

<p>From the investigations of M. Guibourt, it appears that the cocoons are
composed of a large proportion of starch (identical with that found in
the stem of the <i>Echinops</i>, upon which the insect forms its nest), of
gum, a peculiar saccharine matter, a bitter principle, besides earthy
and alkaline salts.</p>

<p>The saccharine principle, which has been especially examined by M.
Berthelot, and named by him <i>Tr&eacute;halose</i>, is a body analogous to
cane-sugar, but possessing distinctive properties, which separate it
from that and all other varieties of sugar.</p>

<p>M. Bourlier states that <i>Tr&eacute;hala</i>, which is abundant in the shops of the
Jew drug-dealers of Constantinople, is frequently used by the Arab and
Turkish physicians in the form of a decoction, which is regarded by them
as of peculiar efficacy in diseases of the respiratory organs.</p>

<p>The second insect-product to which I would draw attention, is a
saccharine substance resembling dark honey. Mr. Loftus, who obtained it
near Kirrind, 13th July, 1851, and whose specimen is in the British
Museum, states that it is exuded from a species of thistle when pierced
by a Rhynchophorous insect; but he fails to inform us for what purposes
it is used by the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Mr. Loftus having also presented the Museum with excellent specimens
both of the plant and insect, I am able to state that the former is
<i>Echinops persicus</i>, Fisch., and the latter a new species of <i>Larinus</i>,
to which M. Jekel has applied the name <i>Larinus mellificus</i>, and of
which he has drawn up the following description:&mdash;</p>

<div class="define">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Larinus mellificus</span>, <i>Jekel</i> (fig. 3). Breviter ovatus, convexus,
niger, nitidus; infra subtiliter, lateribus thoracis margineque

<p>Very similar to <i>L. Onopordinis</i>, but proportionably more elongate and
less convex; rostrum and thorax longer; pilosity of the body underneath
much thinner and shorter; thighs thicker, more clavate, the anterior
evidently costate-rugose underneath; without whitish marks on the
elytra, and without that layer of light-brown earth-like pollinose
transudation which is often wanting in rubbed specimens of <i>Larinus
Onopordinis</i>. The freshest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> specimens have the griseous margin of the
elytra, which parts from the base under the shoulder, obliquely and
angularly ampliate interiorly towards the middle, where it reaches the
second stria. This griseous pilosity fills all the tips of the elytra,
leaving bare only the sutures, an angular notch behind the middle (which
forms with that apical part of the suture a kind of hook on each
elytron), and two round spots, one submarginal fronting the tip of the
notch, the other larger, discoidal, behind the foot of the notch, much
above the tip.</p>
